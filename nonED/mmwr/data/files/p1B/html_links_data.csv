Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Depression is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.
What is added by this report?
During 2020, 18.4% of U.S. adults reported having ever been diagnosed with depression; state-level age-standardized estimates ranged from 12.7% in Hawaii to 27.5% in West Virginia. Model-based age-standardized county-level prevalence estimates ranged from 10.7% to 31.9%, and there was considerable state-level and county-level variability.
What are implications for public health practice?
Decision-makers can use these estimates to guide resource allocation to areas where the need is greatest, possibly by implementing practices such as those recommended by The Guide to Community Preventive Services Task Force and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Depression is a major contributor to mortality, morbidity, disability, and economic costs in the United States (1). Examining the geographic distribution of depression at the state and county levels can help guide state- and local-level efforts to prevent, treat, and manage depression. CDC analyzed 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to estimate the national, state-level, and county-level prevalence of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years self-reporting a lifetime diagnosis of depression (referred to as depression). During 2020, the age-standardized prevalence of depression among adults was 18.5%. Among states, the age-standardized prevalence of depression ranged from 12.7% to 27.5% (median = 19.9%); most of the states with the highest prevalence were in the Appalachian* and southern Mississippi Valley† regions. Among 3,143 counties, the model-based age-standardized prevalence of depression ranged from 10.7% to 31.9% (median = 21.8%); most of the counties with the highest prevalence were in the Appalachian region, the southern Mississippi Valley region, and Missouri, Oklahoma, and Washington. These data can help decision-makers prioritize health planning and interventions in areas with the largest gaps or inequities, which could include implementation of evidence-based interventions and practices such as those recommended by The Guide to Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
BRFSS is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit–dialed landline and cell phone survey of the U.S. adult population aged ≥18 years in all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and participating U.S. territories.§ The combined (landline and cellular) median response rate for the 2020 BRFSS (excluding territories) was 47.6% and ranged among states from 34.5% to 67.2%.¶ A lifetime diagnosis of depression was defined as a “yes” response to the question, “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you had a depressive disorder, including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression?” Among the 2020 BRFSS respondents surveyed in all 50 U.S. states and DC, 392,746 (98.9%) responded to the depression question.
This report presents national, state-level, and county-level point estimates and 95% CIs for the prevalence of depression. National values were directly estimated from weighted BRFSS 2020 data for groups defined by age, sex, race or ethnicity, and education, and state-level estimates were directly estimated from weighted BRFSS 2020 data for each state and DC. Point estimates from survey data were estimated as weighted means and pairwise t-tests were used to determine differences (compared with a reference category) by age group, sex, race or ethnicity, and education level. Differences with p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Because BRFSS is not designed to provide estimates at the county level, county-level estimates were obtained for all 3,143 U.S. counties using multilevel logistic regression and post-stratification.** The multilevel logistic regression model included depression as the binary dependent variable. The model’s independent variables included each respondent’s age group, sex, race and ethnicity, and education level from BRFSS 2020 data, county-level poverty data (<150% of the poverty level) from the 2016–2020 American Community Survey,†† and random effects for state and county. The model parameters were then applied to the U.S. Census Bureau Vintage 2020 county population data to generate model-based county-level estimates of depression prevalence.§§ A Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate 95% CIs for county-level estimates. These model-based county-level estimates were validated by comparing them with the weighted direct survey estimates from counties with sample size ≥500 (183) in BRFSS (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.88). All national and state-level analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN software (version 11; RTI International) to account for the BRFSS complex sample design and weighting, and county-level estimation was conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). All prevalence estimates were age standardized to the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau population.¶¶ This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***
The age-standardized prevalence of depression among U.S. adults was 18.5% (crude = 18.4%) (Table 1). Age-specific prevalence of depression was highest among those aged 18–24 years (21.5%) and lowest among those aged ≥65 years (14.2%). The age-standardized prevalence of depression was higher among women (24.0%) compared with men (13.3%), higher among non-Hispanic White adults (21.9%) compared with non-Hispanic Black or African-American (16.2%), non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (14.6%), Hispanic or Latino (14.6%), and non-Hispanic Asian (7.3%) adults, and higher among adults who had attained less than a high school education (21.2%) compared with adults with a high school education or equivalent (18.5%) and college degree or higher (15.4%).
Among states, the age-standardized prevalence of depression ranged from 12.7% in Hawaii to 27.5% in West Virginia (median = 19.9%) (Table 2). The 10 states with the highest prevalence were (in descending order) West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Vermont, Alabama, Louisiana, Washington, Missouri, and Montana.
Among counties, the model-based age-standardized estimates ranged from 10.7% (Aleutians East Borough County, Alaska) to 31.9% (Logan County, West Virginia) (median = 21.8%) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/129404); most of the counties with the highest prevalence were in the Appalachian region, the southern Mississippi Valley region, and in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Washington (Figure). Estimates of depression also varied among counties within states. For example, even though all county prevalence estimates in West Virginia were in the highest quartile, estimates in the state by county ranged from 24.5% to 31.9%.

Discussion
During 2020, approximately one in five U.S. adults reported having ever received a diagnosis of depression by a health care provider, with prevalence of depression higher in women, younger adults, and adults with lower education levels. Previous reports that focused on measures of current depression (e.g., during the previous 2 weeks) rather than lifetime depression showed similar subgroup differences (2–6), including those observed before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic (4–6).
The highest prevalence of having ever been diagnosed with depression by a health care professional was found among young adults (aged 18–24 years). Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health show that during 2015 to 2019, previous-year depression increased most rapidly among adolescents (aged 12–17 years) and young adults (aged 18–25 years) (4). Depression can affect people differently by age,††† and the American Psychological Association provides clinical practice guidelines and decision aids for the treatment of depression by age group, including children and adolescents, adults, and older adults.§§§ Health promoting behaviors, including physical activity, quality sleep, and good nutrition, can help to manage symptoms of depression and support positive mental health across the lifespan (7).¶¶¶
There was considerable geographic variation in the prevalence of depression, with the highest state and county estimates of depression observed along the Appalachian and southern Mississippi Valley regions. Depression is a comorbidity for many chronic diseases, including diabetes, arthritis, and cardiovascular diseases (8). These diseases also occur in higher concentrations in states within the Appalachian region,**** suggesting that geographic variation in the prevalence of depression might partially reflect patterns of other chronic diseases. The variation in depression might also reflect the influence of social determinants of health†††† in counties and states, including economic status and differences in access to health care. For example, adults in the Appalachian region tend to have lower incomes, higher poverty rates, and lower education levels, all of which can negatively affect health and well-being.§§§§ The model-based county-level estimates provided in this report offer a starting point for identifying geographic disparities in depression. Incorporating additional neighborhood-level data and context can help guide local public health practitioners in the development and implementation of effective and targeted efforts to address mental health in their communities.
Population-level efforts to address prevention, treatment, and management of depression include tailored and targeted programs to address demographic and geographic disparities. CDC provides information about mental health resources and programs, including those focused on specific populations (e.g., children, older adults, and those with chronic conditions). Depression often co-occurs with other health conditions, and chronic disease self-management programs also help persons with chronic conditions manage their disease and improve their mental health.¶¶¶¶ CDC’s How Right Now***** is a communications campaign designed to promote and strengthen the emotional well-being and resilience of persons disproportionally affected by mental health challenges. The campaign offers evidence-based information and resources to address the emotional health needs of adults (9).
In addition, CPSTF provides communities with a list of recommended interventions to improve mental health or address mental illness.††††† Examples of recommended interventions include collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders, mental health benefits legislation, school-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms (targeted and universal), and depression care management among older adults (clinic- and home-based). SAMHSA’s Evidence-Based Practices Resource Center also provides communities, clinicians, policymakers and others with the information and tools to incorporate evidence-based practices into their communities or clinical settings.§§§§§
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, BRFSS collects self-reported data about whether the respondent has ever received a diagnosis of depression from a health care professional and these data are susceptible to recall, nonresponse, cultural and social desirability, and other reporting biases (10). Differences in reporting could be attributed to sex, cultural, and generational differences, and a person’s willingness to discuss symptoms with a health care provider, as well as their access to a provider. Second, data are collected via a landline and cell phone survey that excludes institutionalized populations or those who cannot be reached via this method, which might affect the representativeness of the samples. Finally, county estimates of prevalence might be imprecise because the multilevel regression modeling approach uses the U.S. Census Bureau Vintage 2020 county population estimates, which are estimates of the population rather than census counts.
This report provides current estimates of national, state-level, and county-level prevalence of adults reporting a lifetime diagnosis of depression. These estimates can help decision-makers guide resource allocation to areas where the need is greatest, which might include consideration of evidence-based interventions and practices such as those recommended by CPSTF and SAMHSA.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC has used genomic surveillance to monitor trends in circulating U.S. SARS-CoV-2 variants since December 2020, including the emergence of the Omicron variant at the end of 2021.
What is added by this report?
Weekly estimates of variant proportions during January 2, 2022–May 13, 2023, identified the emergence and subsequent predominance of multiple Omicron lineages in the United States, including BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.5, and XBB.1.5. Repeated independent substitutions in the spike protein suggested convergent evolution related to immune evasion. Analytic methods for variant proportion estimation have been updated as numbers of cases and sequenced specimens have declined.
What are implications for public health practice?
Ongoing genomic surveillance can identify emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and guide vaccine and therapeutic development and use.

CDC has used national genomic surveillance since December 2020 to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Omicron variant. This report summarizes U.S. trends in variant proportions from national genomic surveillance during January 2022–May 2023. During this period, the Omicron variant remained predominant, with various descendant lineages reaching national predominance (>50% prevalence). During the first half of 2022, BA.1.1 reached predominance by the week ending January 8, 2022, followed by BA.2 (March 26), BA.2.12.1 (May 14), and BA.5 (July 2); the predominance of each variant coincided with surges in COVID-19 cases. The latter half of 2022 was characterized by the circulation of sublineages of BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 (e.g., BQ.1 and BQ.1.1), some of which independently acquired similar spike protein substitutions associated with immune evasion. By the end of January 2023, XBB.1.5 became predominant. As of May 13, 2023, the most common circulating lineages were XBB.1.5 (61.5%), XBB.1.9.1 (10.0%), and XBB.1.16 (9.4%); XBB.1.16 and XBB.1.16.1 (2.4%), containing the K478R substitution, and XBB.2.3 (3.2%), containing the P521S substitution, had the fastest doubling times at that point. Analytic methods for estimating variant proportions have been updated as the availability of sequencing specimens has declined. The continued evolution of Omicron lineages highlights the importance of genomic surveillance to monitor emerging variants and help guide vaccine development and use of therapeutics.
CDC’s national genomic surveillance system integrates SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three sources: 1) the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) program,† 2) CDC-contracted commercial laboratories, and 3) public sequence data repositories, including the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) repository and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank.§ Variant proportions generated by genomic surveillance are regularly updated on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker and guide public health measures to address COVID-19¶ (1,2).
Weekly SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences** from the NS3 program, commercial laboratories, and data repositories were quality-filtered,†† deduplicated, and assigned Pango lineages (3). During January 2022–May 2023, the median interval from specimen collection to data availability was 16 days. Weekly variant proportions were estimated at the national and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regional levels§§ by specimen collection date for the 11 weeks before the most recent 3 weeks; lineages were included if they constituted ≥1% (unweighted) of sequences nationally and contained spike protein substitutions of potential therapeutic relevance. To estimate variant proportions for the most recent 3 weeks, nowcasts were generated using multinomial regression fit on the previous 21 weeks of data.¶¶ All methods included weighting to account for the complex survey design and adjust for potential sampling biases.*** Nowcasts were conducted for any lineages with ≥0.5% prevalence beginning October 11, 2022,††† to improve accuracy by accounting for differential growth rates of grouped sublineages. Weekly numbers of COVID-19 cases attributable to variants were estimated by multiplying counts of positive nucleic acid amplification tests from COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting (CELR) with variant proportions. Doubling times for proportions of specific lineages were estimated from the coefficients of the multinomial nowcasting model.§§§ Methodologic changes following the public health emergency expiration (4) were summarized. Biweekly estimates using the updated model were compared with weekly estimates from the previous model to assess consistency. Data were current as of June 1, 2023. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶
During January 2, 2022–May 13, 2023, a total of 1,697,197 SARS-CoV-2 surveillance sequences from 56 U.S. jurisdictions**** were generated by or reported to CDC from NS3 (1%), commercial laboratories (60%), and repositories (38%); the percentage of sequences from repositories represented an increase from 10% during June 2021–January 2022 (1). The weekly number of sequenced specimens decreased from approximately 65,000 collected in January 2022 to approximately 4,400 in April 2023, as the number of COVID-19 cases declined (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/129515).
Omicron remained predominant during January 2, 2022–May 13, 2023, with various descendent lineages emerging and becoming predominant nationwide. The BA.1.1 lineage reached predominance by the week ending January 8, 2022, followed by BA.2 by March 26, BA.2.12.1 by May 14, and BA.5 by July 2 (Figure 1). The prevalence of these lineages peaked at 75.7% (95% CI = 73.8%–77.5%) for BA.1.1 by the week ending February 19, 2022; 73.4% (95% CI = 69.6%–77.0%) for BA.2 by April 16; 62.4% (95% CI = 60.7%–64.0%) for BA.2.12.1 by May 28; and 86.2% (95% CI = 85.2%–87.2%) for BA.5 by August 20. Circulation of these lineages coincided with surges in COVID-19 cases (Figure 1) (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/129516).
During the latter half of 2022, multiple Omicron descendants of BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5,†††† including BA.2.75, BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BA.5.2.6, BN.1, BF.11, and CH.1.1 accounted for >1% of circulating variants at different points (Figure 1). Several of these lineages independently acquired spike receptor binding domain (RBD) substitutions, including R346T, K444T, N460K, and F486S/P (Table). None attained predominance individually; however, BQ.1 (which includes K444T and N460K) and BQ.1.1 (which also includes R346T) reached a combined peak prevalence of 59.3% by December 24, 2022 (BQ.1, 22.1%; BQ.1.1, 37.2%), coinciding with a winter surge in cases (Figure 1) (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/129516).
In late fall 2022, the XBB lineage (recombinant of two BA.2 descendant lineages, BM.1.1.1 and BJ.1, with R346T, G446S, N460K, and F486S RBD substitutions) emerged in the United States, reaching <5% prevalence nationally. XBB.1.5, an XBB descendant (harboring an additional S486P substitution) was initially reported in New York City in October 2022 (5) and first reached predominance in HHS Region 2 (New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) on December 31, 2022, and Region 1 (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) on January 7, 2023 (Figure 2). XBB.1.5 further spread south and west to attain national predominance by January 28, 2023, reaching a peak prevalence of 84.1% (95% CI = 81.4%–86.5%) by April 1 (Figure 1).
As of May 13, 2023, the commonly circulating Omicron lineages were XBB.1.5 (61.5%; 95% CI = 56.4%–66.4%), XBB.1.9.1 (10.0%; 95% CI = 6.8%–14.1%), and XBB.1.16 (9.4%; 95% CI = 6.9%–12.5%), with approximately a 19% combined prevalence of other circulating lineages, including XBB (5.3%), XBB.1.9.2 (4.5%), XBB.2.3 (3.2%), XBB.1.16.1 (2.4%), and XBB.1.5.1 (1.9%). Whereas many circulating XBB lineages share the XBB.1.5 spike sequence, XBB.1.16 and XBB.1.16.1 also contain the K478R RBD substitution and XBB.2.3 also contains the P521S substitution (Table). During the week ending May 13, 2023, the fastest doubling times were observed for XBB.1.16 (15.7 days; 95% CI = 13.9–17.9), XBB.1.16.1 (16.7 days; 95% CI = 14.3–20.2), and XBB.2.3 (20.3 days; 95% CI = 16.6–26.0).
The fastest doubling times among lineages assessed at 1% prevalence during January 2, 2022–May 13, 2023, occurred for BA.2.12.1 (5.4 days; 95% CI = 4.8–6.1), BQ.1.1 (6.3 days; 95% CI = 5.5–7.2), BA.5 (6.8 days; 95% CI = 5.9–8.2), and XBB.1.5 (7.0 days; 95% CI = 5.8–8.6). In comparison, the doubling time for Omicron B.1.1.529 was 3.2 days (1). BA.5, XBB.1.5, and BA.1.1 remained predominant for the longest durations (19, 16, and 10 weeks, respectively). The number of cases attributed to each lineage was highest for BA.1.1 (14 million), B.1.1.529 (9.8 million) and BA.5 (8.0 million) (Figure 1) (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/129516). As of May 13, 2023, XBB.1.5 was associated with 1.8 million cases, with numbers expected to continue increasing.
Beginning May 13, 2023, after the expiration of the public health emergency declaration (4) and in response to declining numbers of cases and sequenced specimens, methodologic changes were made regarding the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data. The reporting cadence and unit of analysis changed from weekly to biweekly, with variant proportions estimated for 2-week periods and nowcast predictions conducted for the most recent 4 weeks,§§§§ and state-specific estimates were discontinued. For calculating survey weights, the level and source for information on positive test results changed to regional-level data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)¶¶¶¶ (6). The previous and updated analytic methods using CELR- and NREVSS-derived survey weights, respectively, produced similar variant proportion estimates for all lineages. An example comparison of national and regional proportions of XBB.1.5 demonstrates the consistency between methodologies (Supplementary Figure 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/129517).

Discussion
During January 2022–May 2023, CDC’s genomic surveillance system detected the emergence and changing prevalence of multiple Omicron lineages nationwide. Predominant lineages included BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.2.12.1 in the first half of 2022 and BA.5 and BQ.1/BQ.1.1 (combined) in the second half. Surges in COVID-19 cases were associated with the emergences of these variants. The rise of XBB.1.5 to predominance in 2023 was characterized by an expansion from the northeastern United States to southeastern and western regions. Multiple Omicron lineages independently acquired similar substitutions (e.g., R346T, K444T, N460K, and F486S/P) in the spike RBD, suggesting that these sites are under selective pressure in the population and drive enhanced viral circulation (7). Accordingly, these substitutions have been observed to be associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies, including previously authorized monoclonal antibody therapies (7,8), and the S486P substitution observed in some XBB-descendent lineages also has been observed to increase infectivity via enhanced angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding affinity (9). XBB lineages with additional substitutions compared with XBB.1.5, namely XBB.1.16, XBB.1.16.1, and XBB.2.3, had the fastest doubling times as of May 13, 2023.
Data on SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant proportions helped guide decisions to revoke the emergency use authorizations for different monoclonal antibody therapies with decreased clinical efficacy against various Omicron lineages starting winter 2021.***** Data on variant proportions were also used by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to recommend the inclusion of BA.4/BA.5 in updated (bivalent) vaccines in June 2022 and are expected to guide decisions about the composition of future COVID-19 vaccines.†††††
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, early SARS-CoV-2 variant proportion estimates might have low precision because of relatively limited data availability and biases in the timing of specimen collection or sequence submission. These effects can be exacerbated by sequencing and reporting lag time (e.g., holidays) or laboratory issues, such as lineage-specific sequencing failures. Second, continued decreases in the number of sequencing specimens available over time affect precision; for this reason, state-specific estimates were discontinued in May 2023. Third, current analyses might differ from previous analyses because of fluctuations in sequencing data sources, changes in Pango lineage definitions, and methodologic updates. Finally, estimates of COVID-19 cases attributed to more recent lineages are affected by case underascertainment because of increasing at-home test use and other changes in test-seeking behaviors.
CDC has maintained national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance since December 2020 to monitor variant proportions and aid in making timely decisions on prevention strategies, including vaccines and therapeutics. Analytic methods have been updated to maintain robust and representative estimates as the availability of sequencing specimens has declined; it is reassuring that the previous and updated weighting methodologies produced consistent estimates. Continued monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the U.S. population is key for guiding public health action, including FDA authorizations for COVID-19 therapeutics and strain selection for vaccines.

Lineages with a prevalence <1% or without spike protein substitutions of potential therapeutic or clinical relevance were aggregated with their parental lineage in the final estimates.
§§§ Doubling times for proportions of specific lineages are based on instantaneous growth rates from the multinomial nowcasting model.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
During August–October 2022, CDC recommended a bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose for all persons aged ≥5 years who had received a monovalent primary vaccination series.
What is added by this report?
During December 2022–April 2023, CDC made recommendations for a single bivalent vaccine dose for most persons aged ≥6 years, bivalent vaccines for children aged 6 months–5 years, and optional additional bivalent booster doses for moderately or severely immunocompromised persons aged ≥6 months and adults aged ≥65 years.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Transition to a single bivalent COVID-19 vaccine dose for most persons, with additional doses for persons at increased risk for severe disease, facilitates implementation of simpler, more flexible recommendations. All persons aged ≥6 months should receive ≥1 bivalent vaccine dose.

Throughout the national public health emergency declared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC, guided by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), has offered evidence-based recommendations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines in U.S. populations after each regulatory action by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). During August 2022–April 2023, FDA amended its Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to authorize the use of a single, age-appropriate, bivalent COVID-19 vaccine dose (i.e., containing components from the ancestral and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains in equal amounts) for all persons aged ≥6 years, use of bivalent COVID-19 vaccine doses for children aged 6 months–5 years, and additional bivalent doses for immunocompromised persons and adults aged ≥65 years (1). ACIP voted in September 2022 on the use of the bivalent vaccine, and CDC made recommendations after the September vote and subsequently, through April 2023, with input from ACIP. This transition to a single bivalent COVID-19 vaccine dose for most persons, with additional doses for persons at increased risk for severe disease, facilitates implementation of simpler, more flexible recommendations. Three COVID-19 vaccines are currently available for use in the United States and recommended by ACIP: 1) the bivalent mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, 2) the bivalent mRNA Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and 3) the monovalent adjuvanted, protein subunit-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.* As of August 31, 2022, monovalent mRNA vaccines based on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain are no longer authorized for use in the United States (1).
Since June 2020, ACIP has convened 35 public meetings to review data relevant to the potential use of COVID-19 vaccines.† The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group, comprising experts in adult and pediatric medicine, infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, has met weekly to review COVID-19 surveillance data, evidence for immunogenicity, efficacy, postauthorization effectiveness, safety of COVID-19 vaccines, and implementation considerations. To assess the evidence for benefits and harms associated with use of bivalent vaccines, and to guide deliberations, ACIP used the Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) Framework.§ Within this framework, ACIP considered the importance of COVID-19 as a public health problem, including during the Omicron-predominant era, as well as issues of resource use, benefits and harms, patients’ values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, and equity related to use of the vaccines. ACIP held three public meetings on September 1, 2022, February 24, 2023, and April 19, 2023, to discuss bivalent vaccine policy using the EtR Framework. ACIP voted on adult bivalent doses on September 1, 2022. Authorization for bivalent vaccines was subsequently extended to additional age groups, and CDC updated recommendations, guided by February 24, 2023, and April 19, 2023, input from ACIP (Box). To better protect against the Omicron variant, which emerged in November 2021, ACIP recommended a dose of bivalent mRNA vaccine (containing mRNA encoding the spike protein from both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 variants) in September 2022 (2). Among persons who had only received monovalent COVID-19 vaccines, bivalent COVID-19 vaccines have provided additional protection against infection and COVID-19–associated hospitalization; however, that protection might wane over time (3). From September 2022 to March 2023, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against emergency department and urgent care visits by adults aged 18–64 years waned from 53% (95% CI = 48%–58%) at 7–59 days after receipt of a bivalent dose to 42% (95% CI = 35%–47%) at 60–119 days. Protection against hospitalization among adults aged 18–64 years without an immunocompromising condition waned from 68% (95% CI = 53%–79%) at 7–59 days to 27% (95% CI = 2%–46%) at 60–119 days (3).
Top
As of May 6, 2023, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates were highest among adults aged ≥65 years (9.5 per 100,000 persons).¶ Bivalent booster doses are shown to provide the highest protection against hospitalization among adults, with protection sustained through at least 179 days against critical outcomes, including intensive care unit admission or in-hospital death (4). However, only 17% of the U.S. population overall and 43.3% of adults aged ≥65 years have received a bivalent dose.** Primary series coverage (i.e., receipt of a complete COVID-19 vaccination series) follows a similar pattern: it is highest among older adults and lowest among young children.

Recommendations for Use of Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccines in Persons Aged ≥6 Years Without Immunocompromising Conditions
On April 18, 2023, FDA authorized, and on April 20, 2023, CDC recommended a single, age-appropriate bivalent mRNA dose for unvaccinated persons aged ≥6 years without moderate or severe immunocompromise. Previously vaccinated persons without moderate or severe immunocompromise were recommended to receive the vaccine ≥2 months after receipt of any monovalent vaccine dose (Table).
CDC’s recommendation was based on input from ACIP during public meetings held on February 24, 2023, and April 19, 2023. At these meetings, discussions were guided by clinical trial data demonstrating that bivalent vaccines induce an immune response when administered as a primary series. Immunogenicity data demonstrated that a primary series of an Omicron BA.1-containing bivalent vaccine induced neutralization titers against BA.1 that were approximately 25 times those induced by the original monovalent vaccine†† (5). The percentage of patients reporting solicited systemic and local reactogenicity after receiving the BA.1-containing vaccine was similar to or less than the percentage reporting these reactions after a receipt of a monovalent vaccine.§§ Unsolicited adverse events generally represented illnesses and commonly reported events during infancy and childhood (5).
CDC recommendations were also guided by ACIP discussions of seroprevalence data indicating that, for most older children, adolescents, and adults, future doses will provide an additional boost after previous infection, previous vaccination, or both. In a March–December 2022 nationwide seroprevalence study conducted among children aged 6 months–17 years, most children and adolescents had evidence of infection-induced immunity; prevalence of infection-induced immunity was highest among persons aged 5–11 and 12–17 years (93%) and lowest among children aged 6–11 months (63%) (6). Most adults also had preexisting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In a January–March 2022 seroprevalence study of adult blood donors aged ≥16 years, 96% had evidence of immunity from either previous infection, previous vaccination, or both (7).
A rare risk for myocarditis and pericarditis has been identified after receipt of monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, primarily in adolescent and young adult males. Because data are limited, the risk for myocarditis or pericarditis after receipt of a bivalent dose is not known; however, preliminary estimates suggest that the risk is lower than that observed after a second primary series monovalent dose (8). Higher rates of myocarditis have also been associated with a shorter interval between doses (9). Because of the small number of doses administered among adolescent and young adult males, estimating the incidence of myocarditis after a bivalent dose was not possible; however, only a single case of myopericarditis has been observed in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (a postauthorization vaccine safety monitoring system) during the 7 days after receipt of a bivalent dose in a male aged 18–29 years (8).
Recommendations from CDC were also guided by ACIP discussions of the benefits (i.e., reduction in the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and the number of deaths prevented) per 1 million primary series and bivalent vaccine doses administered, stratified by both age group and interval between primary series completion and receipt of a first bivalent dose. Benefits of a primary series and bivalent dose were seen among all age groups and at all intervals; however, the largest observed benefits were among the oldest age groups and those with the longest interval (i.e., ≥11 months) between completion of the primary series and receipt of the bivalent dose (10). Regular review of safety data, including myocarditis and pericarditis risk after bivalent doses, will continue in national safety surveillance systems.

Recommendations for Use of Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged 6 Months–5 Years
During December 2022–April 2023, FDA amended multiple authorizations for bivalent mRNA vaccines for children aged 6 months–5 years. During this period, CDC updated recommendations, with input from ACIP, for children in this age group for use of bivalent doses based on a child’s vaccination history (Table).
Among children aged 6 months–4 years, either mRNA vaccine may be used; however, all doses administered to a given child must be from the same manufacturer. Among those receiving Moderna vaccine, ≥2 doses are authorized, including ≥1 bivalent vaccine dose. Among those receiving Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, ≥3 doses are authorized, including ≥1 bivalent vaccine dose.
Based on FDA authorizations, unvaccinated children aged 5 years are authorized to receive 2 doses of Moderna bivalent vaccine (with 4–8 weeks between doses) or 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Children aged 5 years who received 1 or 2 doses of monovalent Moderna vaccine are authorized to receive 1 dose of either the bivalent Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.¶¶ Those who received ≥1 doses of monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are authorized to receive ≥1 bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses.
CDC recommendations for pediatric immunization were guided by ACIP discussion of studies of bivalent vaccine given as a primary series in children, as well as booster doses among adults, demonstrating that a bivalent dose of either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine broadens the immune response in persons who have received a primary series and a previous monovalent booster dose (5). Compared with a monovalent booster dose (based on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain), the immune response to Omicron was superior and that to the ancestral strain was noninferior among bivalent vaccine booster dose recipients. Monovalent booster doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were studied in a clinical trial of 145 children aged 17 months–5 years who had received a Moderna primary series 8–13 months previously. Antibody levels after receipt of the monovalent booster dose in a subset of 56 children without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were four times higher than were levels after the primary series in 294 young adults (11). Reactogenicity was similar to that observed after receipt of booster doses in other age groups. In a subset of 60 Pfizer-BioNTech pediatric trial participants aged 6 months–4 years who received a single bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose after completion of a 3-dose monovalent primary series, Omicron BA.4/BA.5–specific antibodies were higher compared with those among children who completed the 3-dose primary series of monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and did not receive the bivalent booster dose. The bivalent dose was generally well-tolerated, with a lower frequency of postvaccination local and systemic reactions than previously observed in this age group with monovalent doses; no new or concerning safety findings were identified (12).

Additional Bivalent COVID-19 Doses for Adults Aged ≥65 Years and for Persons Aged ≥6 Months Who Are Moderately or Severely Immunocompromised
In April 2023, FDA granted an EUA for additional bivalent doses for adults aged ≥65 years and for persons aged ≥6 months with immunocompromise. Adults aged ≥65 years have the option to receive 1 additional bivalent vaccine dose ≥4 months after receipt of the most recent bivalent dose (Table). Persons aged ≥6 months who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have the option to receive ≥1 additional bivalent doses ≥2 months after receipt of the most recent bivalent dose and additional bivalent mRNA doses, as indicated, based on individual circumstances and clinical judgment.*** The option to receive ≥1 additional bivalent mRNA vaccine doses may be based on the clinical judgment of a health care provider, a person’s risk for severe COVID-19 because of the presence of underlying medial conditions and age, and personal preference and circumstances.
CDC made recommendations based on ACIP discussions of VE and clinical epidemiology of COVID-19 among moderately or severely immunocompromised persons and adults aged ≥65 years. Effectiveness of a bivalent vaccine booster dose against hospitalization in adults aged ≥18 years with immunocompromising conditions was 30% (95% CI = 12%–44%) at 7–59 days postvaccination and 31% (95% CI = 4%–50%) at 120–179 days (3). Among adults aged ≥65 years, waning of absolute VE has been noted after receipt of a bivalent dose. Effectiveness of bivalent vaccines against COVID-19–associated emergency department or urgent care encounters among immunocompetent adults aged ≥65 years declined from 61% (95% CI = 57%–64%) 7–59 days after vaccination to 25% (95% CI = 16%–34%) at 120–179 days (3). VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization declined from 64% (95% CI = 59%–69%) 7–59 days after vaccination to 39% (95% CI = 26%–50%) at 120–179 days (3).

Implementation Considerations
Before the authorization of a bivalent dose for most persons, 11 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine products were licensed or authorized for use. Authorization of a bivalent dose for most persons reduced the total number of vaccine products to five and eliminated vials that appear similar (i.e., look-alike vials) (13); these recommendations will thereby simplify implementation for COVID-19 vaccine providers. Reducing the number of products will expand providers’ storage space and, in conjunction with the elimination of look-alike vials, might reduce vaccine administration errors.
The transition from a monovalent primary series to a single bivalent dose for most persons, and additional bivalent doses for populations at higher risk for severe disease, allows the COVID-19 vaccination program to progress toward simpler, more flexible, evidence-based recommendations. COVID-19 vaccination remains critical to protecting against serious consequences of COVID-19, and all persons aged ≥6 months should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, including receiving ≥1 bivalent vaccine dose.
Before vaccination, providers should provide the EUA Fact Sheet for the vaccine being administered and counsel vaccine recipients about expected systemic and local adverse reactions (reactogenicity). Additional clinical education materials are available,††† including further clinical considerations.§§§ These interim recommendations and clinical considerations are based on currently available information regarding bivalent COVID-19 vaccine doses and might change as more evidence becomes available.

Reporting of Vaccine Adverse Events
Adverse events that occur after receipt of any COVID-19 vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS, https://vaers.hhs.gov or 1-800-822-7967). Vaccination providers are required by FDA to report vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of myocarditis, cases of pericarditis, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, hospitalization or death, and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death after administration of COVID-19 vaccine under EUA. Reporting is encouraged for any clinically significant adverse event even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event.

Meningococcal disease, caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, is a sudden-onset, life-threatening illness that typically occurs as meningitis or meningococcemia. The most common signs and symptoms of meningitis include fever, headache, and stiff neck; the most common signs and symptoms of meningococcemia are fever, chills, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, cold hands and feet, and severe aches or pain.* Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccination (MenACWY) is routinely recommended for adolescents and persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease (1), including those with HIV. In 2016, a 2-dose series of MenACWY was recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for persons with HIV and incorporated into the U.S. immunization schedule. Coverage among persons with HIV, however, remains low: in a study of administrative claims data during January 2016–March 2018, only 16.3% of persons with HIV received ≥1 doses of MenACWY vaccine within 2 years after their diagnosis (2). This report describes an increase in meningococcal disease among persons with HIV in the United States in 2022. Data are typically finalized in the fall of the next year; therefore, this report is based on preliminary data for 2022.
Meningococcal disease cases are reported through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, with additional epidemiologic information and isolates obtained through Enhanced Meningococcal Disease Surveillance. Isolates are characterized using whole genome sequencing to determine serogroup and molecular typing information. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
During 2017–2021, five to 15 meningococcal disease cases were reported each year among persons with HIV, representing 1.5%–4.3% of all meningococcal disease cases annually (Figure). Based on preliminary data, 29 meningococcal disease cases have been reported among persons with HIV in 2022, accounting for 9.8% of all cases. This case count might increase when reporting is complete.
Among the 29 meningococcal disease cases among persons with HIV in 2022, 22 had not received MenACWY vaccine, six had unknown MenACWY vaccination history, and one had received MenACWY vaccine, but the number of doses received was unknown. Fifteen of the 29 cases were part of a large serogroup C outbreak that occurred primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM); however, after excluding MSM outbreak-associated cases for all years, a substantial increase in meningococcal disease cases among persons with HIV in 2022 remained (i.e., 14 cases compared with four to eight cases per year during 2017–2021) (Figure). Of the 14 cases among persons with HIV in 2022 that were not related to the outbreak primarily among MSM, nine were caused by a single strain of N. meningitidis serogroup Y clonal complex CC174 sequence type ST-1466. Eight of these nine cases occurred in Black or African American persons, and seven occurred among MSM. The nine cases caused by a single strain were reported from three states with no identified connections among cases. The remaining five cases were not clustered geographically and had no identified epidemiologic connections.
MenACWY vaccine coverage among persons with HIV is low; given the recent increase in meningococcal disease cases in this population, health care providers should ensure that all persons with HIV are up to date with MenACWY vaccination per ACIP recommendations, as well as other vaccines recommended for this population. Health care providers should also maintain a high index of suspicion for meningococcal disease among persons with HIV who have symptoms of meningococcal disease. CDC recommends that all persons be screened for HIV at least once in their lifetime (3). Providers should ensure that patients with meningococcal disease and unknown HIV status are screened for HIV.

During June 2022, a non–English-speaking, Mexican-born male construction worker aged 42 years was evaluated at an Oregon emergency department (ED) complaining of 2 days of difficulty opening his mouth and pain in his back, arms, and neck. After receiving intravenous (IV) fluids and diazepam, he improved and was discharged. The following day, he visited a different ED with worsening symptoms, but again was discharged following administration of IV fluids and diazepam. He returned hours later with trismus and diffuse body spasms at which time a clinical diagnosis of tetanus was made. Immunization history was not documented during the first two ED visits. During the third ED visit, his family reported he had recently stepped on a nail at work and that he had no known history of tetanus immunization.
He was admitted to the hospital where he received IV metronidazole, tetanus immune globulin, tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Shortly thereafter, he experienced respiratory distress and was intubated. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a larger hospital, where a punctate callus was noted on the sole of the right foot. A tracheostomy was placed on day 13. He remained in the ICU through day 45. The tracheostomy was removed on day 48. At the time of discharge (day 50), he could speak, eat, drink, and walk short distances.
Tetanus is caused by a neurotoxin expressed by Clostridium tetani, an anaerobic, spore-forming gram-positive bacterium commonly found in soil and introduced through open wounds. Often life-threatening, tetanus can require months of medical care before recovery. During 2017, the cost for an unvaccinated pediatric patient in Oregon hospitalized with tetanus for 57 days exceeded $800,000 (1). Tetanus is preventable through a primary 3-dose diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccination series at 2, 4, and 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15–18 months and 4–6 years. Persons aged 11–18 years should receive a single booster dose of Tdap, preferably during a preventive care visit at age 11–12 years. To ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, booster doses of Td or Tdap should be administered every 10 years throughout life. CDC recommends that adults with no history of vaccination against tetanus receive tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.* Migrant workers might be at increased risk for tetanus: their occupational injury risk has been shown to be twice that of U.S.-born workers (2).
Health care providers should be on alert for reemerging vaccine-preventable diseases as a result of declines in vaccination coverage attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.† Providers should also be aware that migrant populations often have lower vaccination coverage rates and suffer higher rates of vaccine-preventable diseases than do nonmigrants (3). In the United States, vaccination coverage is significantly lower among non- U.S-born than among U.S.-born adults (4). Across the Americas, national vaccination schedules have largely reached parity during recent decades, ensuring high coverage among children and young adults; however, coverage among adults is lower. Mexico, the country representing the largest U.S. migrant population, lags behind the United States in immunization metrics: during 2022, 3-dose DTaP coverage among Mexican children aged 1 year was 74%, compared with 93% in the United States, and receipt of 2 measles-containing vaccine doses by the nationally recommended age was 78% in Mexico and 85% in the United States.§ Providers in the United States should remain particularly vigilant for vaccine-preventable diseases among non–U.S.-born patients and take every opportunity to administer recommended vaccines.
Ineffective communication between providers and patients can delay treatment. The patient described in this report did not have his immunization history documented until his third ED visit, and only after the diagnosis of tetanus was apparent. To mitigate language barriers, clinical care settings should provide interpreter services for non–English-speaking communities. Providers should be mindful that some Hispanic or Latino immigrants in the United States have limited health literacy, hindering quality of care (5). To address issues of health literacy, providers should consider use of both written and oral formats, photonovelas (picture stories), and “teach-back” methods¶.
This preventable tetanus case highlights the importance of equitable communication practices in health care settings, vigilance for serious but rare vaccine-preventable diseases, early ascertainment of immunization history, and awareness of possible lower vaccination coverage among migrant populations. Persons lacking verified immunization should be offered vaccination expeditiously.

Updated (bivalent) COVID-19 vaccines were first recommended by CDC on September 1, 2022.* An analysis of case and death rates by vaccination status shortly after authorization of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines showed that receipt of a bivalent booster dose provided additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated death (1). In this follow-up report on the durability of bivalent booster protection against death among adults aged ≥65 years, mortality rate ratios (RRs) were estimated among unvaccinated persons and those who received a bivalent booster dose by time since vaccination during three periods of Omicron lineage predominance (BA.5 [September 18–November 5, 2022], BQ.1/BQ.1.1 [November 6, 2022–January 21, 2023], and XBB.1.5 [January 22–April 1, 2023]).†
During September 18, 2022–April 1, 2023, weekly counts of COVID-19–associated deaths§ among unvaccinated persons and those who received a bivalent booster dose¶ were reported from 20 U.S. jurisdictions** that routinely link case surveillance data to immunization registries and vital registration databases (1). Vaccinated persons who did not receive a bivalent COVID-19 booster dose were excluded. Rate denominators were calculated from vaccine administration data and 2019 U.S. intercensal population estimates,†† with numbers of unvaccinated persons estimated by subtracting numbers of vaccinated persons from the 2019 intercensal population estimates, as previously described§§ (1). Average weekly mortality rates were estimated based on date of specimen collection¶¶ during each variant period by vaccination status and time since bivalent booster dose receipt. RRs were calculated by dividing rates among unvaccinated persons by rates among bivalent booster dose recipients; after detrending the underlying linear changes in weekly rates, 95% CIs were estimated from the remaining variation in rates observed*** (1). SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.1.2; R Foundation) software were used to conduct all analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†††
Among adults aged ≥65 years who were unvaccinated or had received a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster dose, 8,161 COVID-19–associated deaths in the 20 U.S. jurisdictions were reported during September 18, 2022–April 1, 2023. Overall, 58% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥80 years; this distribution was consistent among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons and across the three variant periods. Mortality rates among adults aged ≥65 years peaked in December 2022 during the BQ.1/BQ.1.1 predominance period. Higher mortality rates were observed among unvaccinated persons during all three periods of Omicron lineage predominance (Table).
In time-stratified analyses comparing mortality rates among unvaccinated persons with those among vaccinated persons 2 weeks–2 months after receipt of a bivalent booster dose, mortality RRs significantly declined from 16.3 during the BA.5-predominant period to 8.4 during the XBB.1.5-predominant period, representing a modest reduction in crude vaccine effectiveness from 94% to 88%.§§§ Mortality RRs were similar among persons who had received a bivalent booster dose either 2 weeks–2 months earlier or 3–6 months earlier in the BQ.1/BQ.1.1-predominant period (11.4 and 11.0, respectively) and in the XBB.1.5-predominant period (8.4 and 7.3, respectively).¶¶¶
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, this ecologic study using surveillance data could not adjust for important confounders, such as variations in infection-derived immunity, comorbidities, and testing or prevention behaviors, which might contribute to mortality rate differences by vaccination status. Second, a decrease in mortality during the XBB.1.5 period limited sample sizes and statistical power. Third, only seven of 20 jurisdictions were able to include COVID-19–associated deaths without laboratory-confirmation, which have increased over time.**** Fourth, potential misclassification of bivalent and monovalent booster doses could influence RRs (2). Fifth, a small proportion (0.3%) of persons received a second bivalent booster before April 1, 2023, although this was not authorized for some persons until April 19, 2023.†††† Finally, these data represent approximately 41% of the U.S. population, and therefore, might not be generalizable.
In this assessment of the durability of protection afforded by a bivalent booster dose against COVID-19–associated death among adults aged ≥65 years, receipt of a bivalent booster dose provided substantial protection, with no significant evidence of waning up to 6 months postvaccination; this finding is similar to other studies assessing vaccine effectiveness against critical illness and death (1,3,4). However, some immune evasion was observed during the Omicron XBB.1.5 period (evidenced by a 6% decrease in vaccine effectiveness compared with that during the BA.5 period), likely related to changes in the spike protein relative to the BA.4/BA.5 spike contained in the bivalent vaccine. These findings are relevant to future decisions on COVID-19 vaccine composition.§§§§ With the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023, routine monitoring of incidence, hospitalization rates, and death rates by vaccination status has been discontinued; however, CDC will continue to monitor vaccine effectiveness through well-controlled studies (e.g., the VISION and IVY networks) (5). All persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including ≥1 bivalent dose for persons aged ≥6 months. Additional bivalent vaccine doses are optional for adults aged ≥65 years and immunocompromised persons.

† National weighted estimates of weekly proportions of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are reported by CDC (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions). Analysis periods were categorized based on Omicron lineage predominance (>50% of sequenced lineages) for BA.5 (September 18–November 5, 2022) and XBB.1.5 (January 22–April 1, 2023). The BQ.1/BQ.1.1 period (November 6, 2022–January 21, 2023) also included other lineages with similar mutations and was defined based on when BA.5 reached <50% related to the rise of these other lineages.
§ A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died and whose report local health authorities reviewed to make that determination (e.g., using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources). Per national guidance, this group should include persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 as an underlying cause or a significant condition contributing to death (https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CSTE-Revised-Classification-of-COVID-19-associated-Deaths.Final_.11.22.22.pdf). In some jurisdictions, deaths that were not laboratory-confirmed were included.
¶ Unvaccinated persons did not receive any COVID-19 vaccine doses. Persons vaccinated with a bivalent booster dose received a primary series and an authorized bivalent COVID-19 vaccine dose on or after September 1, 2022, and ≥14 days before the positive specimen collection date; bivalent vaccines reported as first or second doses are classified as bivalent booster doses. Reinfections occurring ≥90 days after a previous infection were included.
** The 20 jurisdictions included in this analysis represent 41% of the U.S. population: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.

§§ A continuity correction was applied to denominators by capping vaccination coverage at 95%; it was assumed that ≥5% of each age group would be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population and prevents incidence and death rates from growing unrealistically large because of potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.
¶¶ For deaths that were not laboratory-confirmed, alternative reference dates were used in lieu of positive specimen collection date (i.e., symptom onset date or date of death or report date when symptom onset date was unavailable).
*** 95% CIs were calculated after detrending underlying linear changes in weekly rates using piecewise linear regression. Each 95% CI represents the remaining variation in observed weekly rates and resulting RRs. The number of observations leading to each 95% CI reflects the number of weeks per period: BA.5 (7 weeks), BQ.1/BQ.1.1 (11 weeks), and XBB.1.5 (10 weeks).

§§§ To interpret RR changes, age group-specific crude vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1 − [incidence in vaccinated / incidence in unvaccinated]) x 100%.
¶¶¶ The median time since vaccination during the 2 weeks–2 months postvaccination category (14–89 days) was 22 days for the BA.5 period, 58 days for the BQ.1/BQ.1.1 period, and 72 days for the XBB.1.5 period. For the period 3–6 months since vaccination (90–212 days), the median time was 101 days during the BQ.1/BQ.1.1 period and 132 days for the XBB.1.5 period.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The primary means for detecting poliovirus is through acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, which is supplemented by environmental surveillance of sewage samples.
What is added by this report?
During 2021–2022, among 34 priority countries experiencing or at high risk for poliovirus transmission, 26 (76.5%) met national AFP surveillance indicator targets, and the number of environmental surveillance sites increased by 31%. However, substantial national and subnational AFP surveillance gaps persist.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Maintaining high-quality surveillance is critical to achieving the goal of global polio eradication. Monitoring surveillance indicators is important to identify gaps and guide surveillance-strengthening activities, particularly in countries at high risk for poliovirus circulation.

Table 1
Table 2
Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was established in 1988, the number of wild poliovirus (WPV) cases has declined by >99.9%, and WPV serotypes 2 and 3 have been declared eradicated (1). By the end of 2022, WPV type 1 (WPV1) transmission remained endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan (2,3). However, during 2021–2022, Malawi and Mozambique reported nine WPV1 cases that were genetically linked to Pakistan (4,5), and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks were detected in 42 countries (6). cVDPVs are oral poliovirus vaccine-derived viruses that can emerge after prolonged circulation in populations with low immunity allowing reversion to neurovirulence and can cause paralysis. Polioviruses are detected primarily through surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and poliovirus is confirmed through stool specimen testing. Environmental surveillance, the systematic sampling of sewage and testing for the presence of poliovirus, supplements AFP surveillance. Both surveillance systems were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on public health activities during 2020 (7,8) but improved in 2021 (9). This report updates previous reports (7,9) to describe surveillance performance during 2021–2022 in 34 priority countries.* In 2022, a total of 26 (76.5%) priority countries met the two key AFP surveillance performance indicator targets nationally compared with 24 (70.6%) countries in 2021; however, substantial gaps remain in subnational areas. Environmental surveillance expanded to 725 sites in priority countries, a 31.1% increase from the 553 sites reported in 2021. High-quality surveillance is critical to rapidly detect poliovirus transmission and enable prompt poliovirus outbreak response to stop circulation. Frequent monitoring of surveillance guides improvements to achieve progress toward polio eradication.

Acute Flaccid Paralysis Surveillance
Performance Indicators. AFP surveillance quality is assessed using two performance indicators: 1) the nonpolio AFP (NPAFP) rate, by which an NPAFP rate of at least two per 100,000 persons aged <15 years is deemed sufficiently sensitive to detect circulating poliovirus, and 2) stool adequacy,† with the target of ≥80% adequate stool specimens collected from AFP patients indicating effective identification of poliovirus. Surveillance indicators were assessed in 34 priority countries during 2021–2022 and summarized by region (Table 1).
African Region. Among 24 priority countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region (AFR), 19 (79.2%) met both national AFP surveillance indicator targets in 2022 compared with 17 (70.8%) in 2021 (Table 1). In 2022, all 24 countries met the NPAFP rate target nationally, and 19 (79.2%) met the stool adequacy target. Indicators at the first subnational administrative level (i.e., province or state) were similar both years, with 73.2% and 72.4% of subnational areas meeting both targets in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Figure). In 2022, ≥80% of subnational areas in 21 (87.5%) countries met the NPAFP rate target compared with 20 (83.3%) countries in 2021. The stool adequacy target was met by more than 80% of subnational areas in 10 (41.7%) countries in 2022 compared with 11 (45.8%) countries in 2021. Subnational area stool adequacy performance varied; nine countries (37.5%) reported more subnational areas meeting the target in 2022, and six (25.0%) reported fewer. In 2022, eight WPV1 cases were detected, and one WPV1 case had onset in 2021. The number of VDPV cases increased from 512 (13 cVDPV type 1 [cVDPV1] cases and 499 cVDPV type 2 [cVDPV2] cases) in 2021 to 653 (173 cVDPV1 and 480 cVDPV2) in 2022.
Eastern Mediterranean Region. All seven priority countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) met both national surveillance indicator targets in 2021 and 2022. In 2022, 88.2% of subnational areas met both indicator targets compared with 89.0% in 2021. EMR reported 22 WPV1 and 168 cVDPV2 cases in 2022 compared with five WPV1, three cVDPV1, and 118 cVDPV2 in 2021.
South-East Asia Region. In the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR) priority country of Burma (Myanmar)§, the NPAFP rate improved from 0.2 to 1.1 cases per 100,000 but remained below the target. In 2021 and 2022, Burma met stool adequacy targets (84.8% and 88.0%, respectively). Three (16.7%) of 18 subnational areas met both NPAFP rates and stool adequacy targets in 2022 compared with none in 2021. No poliovirus cases were detected in Burma during 2021–2022.
Western Pacific Region. Of the two priority countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region (WPR), neither Papua New Guinea nor the Philippines met both national surveillance indicator targets during the assessment period. In Papua New Guinea, the NPAFP rate (1.3 in 2021 and 1.4 in 2022) was below target; stool adequacy increased from 50% in 2021 to 57.8% in 2022 but remained below target. In 2021 and 2022, the Philippines met NPAFP rate targets (2.6 and 2.2, respectively) but missed stool adequacy targets (78.4% and 79.3%, respectively). Across both countries, the number of subnational areas meeting both indicators declined from 20.5% in 2021 to 10.3% in 2022. No poliovirus was detected in the two WPR priority countries in 2021 or 2022.

Environmental Surveillance
Environmental surveillance for poliovirus, the systematic collection and testing of sewage samples for poliovirus, supplements the sensitivity of AFP surveillance by detecting poliovirus circulation in the absence of confirmed paralytic polio cases. In 2022, 32 (94.1%) of the priority countries¶ reported 725 environmental surveillance sites compared with 553 sites in 2021, a 31.1% increase. Performance (sensitivity to detect poliovirus) is assessed by the annual enterovirus isolation rate, the proportion of environmental samples that have positive test results for any polio or nonpolio enterovirus, with a target of ≥50%.**
In AFR, the number of sites increased 11.9%, from 371 in 2021 to 415 in 2022, and the overall proportion of sites meeting the target increased from 27.8% to 40.5%. Eleven (47.8%) countries reported an increase in the proportion of sites meeting the indicator in 2022, and seven (30.4%) countries reported a decrease.
The number of sites in EMR increased from 162 in 2021 to 294 in 2022, including 120 added in Pakistan. More than 85% of sites met the indicator in each year.
In SEAR and WPR, Burma’s single reporting site met the environmental surveillance indicator. The Philippines had 17 environmental sites in 2021, five (29.4%) of which met the indicator. In 2022, 15 sites reported, and four (26.7%) met the indicator.

Global Polio Laboratory Network
The Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) consists of 144 WHO-accredited laboratories in the six WHO regions, monitored through a standardized quality assurance program of annual on-site audits and proficiency tests (10). All 144 GPLN laboratories are responsible for isolating polioviruses; 134 conduct intratypic differentiation to identify WPV, VDPV, and Sabin (oral poliovirus vaccine)†† polioviruses; and 28 conduct genomic sequencing. These 28 laboratories participated in global proficiency testing, analyzed the region of the poliovirus genome that codes for the capsid viral protein 1 (VP1), and demonstrated their ability to accurately characterize poliovirus in stool specimens (10).
In 2022, GPLN tested 193,945 stool specimens collected from patients with AFP (Table 2). Three of six regions (the Americas [AMR], EMR, and European [EUR]) did not meet the timeliness indicator for poliovirus isolation (results reported for ≥80% of specimens ≤14 days after receipt); however, all regions met the timeliness indicator for intratypic differentiation (results reported for more than 80% of specimens, both ≤7 days of receipt of isolate and ≤60 days of paralysis onset).
During 2021–2022, the South Asia (SOAS) genotype was the only circulating WPV1 isolated from 36 AFP patients, 27 from the two endemic countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan), and nine from two nonendemic countries (Malawi and Mozambique). In Pakistan, 21 WPV1 cases were related to the YB3C genetic cluster (i.e., groups of polioviruses sharing ≥95% sequence identity in the region coding VP1), two of which were orphan viruses.§§ The YB3C cluster was also found in the nine cases from Malawi and Mozambique and two cases detected in Afghanistan. Cluster YB3A was detected in three cases in Afghanistan and in environmental samples in Pakistan. Two additional distinct clusters (YB3B and XC2B) were detected in environmental samples collected in Pakistan during 2021.
In priority countries during 2021–2022, 38 cVDPV emergence groups (eight cVDPV1 and 30 cVDPV2) were isolated from 1,454 AFP patients and 750 environmental samples. The number of cVDPV1 emergence groups increased from four isolated from 16 AFP patients and 33 environmental samples in 2021 to seven from 173 patients and 99 samples in 2022. The number of cVDPV2 emergence groups decreased from 24 isolated from 617 AFP patients and 449 environmental samples in 2021 to 17 emergence groups isolated from 648 patients and 169 samples in 2022.

Discussion
After the COVID-19 pandemic weakened poliovirus surveillance performance (7,8), NPAFP rates during 2022 improved in most priority countries in AFR and EMR; improvements in stool adequacy, however, were only marginal. All high-priority countries in AFR and EMR met national NPAFP rate targets, and 26 of 31 countries met stool adequacy targets. Subnational surveillance gaps exist, particularly for stool adequacy, with 14 of 24 AFR countries and one of seven EMR countries reporting <80% of subnational areas meeting the target. SEAR and WPR priority countries and subnational areas showed improvement in 2022 but not enough to meet targets.
The detection of WPV1 in Malawi and Mozambique (4,5) highlights the risk for importation and the importance of monitoring surveillance performance to detect transmission. Substantial surveillance gaps persist in both countries, with <25% of the population living in areas that met both AFP surveillance indicators in 2022. The 653 VDPV cases detected in 42 countries during 2022 also emphasize the importance of sensitive and timely surveillance to help response activities interrupt poliovirus transmission. While polioviruses continue to circulate, all countries remain at risk for importation and must strengthen and maintain surveillance.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the NPAFP rate depends on the accurate identification of AFP cases; however, the data presented in this study might include cases not meeting the AFP case definition and exclude actual AFP cases that were not reported. Environmental surveillance improves sensitivity without relying on AFP case detection. Second, AFP surveillance measures of timeliness depend on the accurate identification of paralysis onset date during the field investigation. Third, performance measures reported at regional and national levels can obscure variation at lower administrative levels. Finally, populations living in hard-to-access areas might not be adequately identified by the surveillance system and could affect subnational surveillance indicators and limit their interpretation.
High-quality surveillance is critical for the timely detection of circulating poliovirus and the rapid activation of outbreak response vaccination activities to stop transmission. Countries should maintain high-quality surveillance by monitoring surveillance indicators to identify gaps, enhance the sensitivity and timeliness of surveillance activities, and guide program decision-making toward polio eradication.

As of May 7, 2023, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all children aged 6 months–5 years receive at least 1 age-appropriate bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. Depending on their COVID-19 vaccination history and history of immunocompromise, these children might also need additional doses* (1–3). Initial vaccine safety findings after primary series vaccination among children aged 6 months–5 years showed that transient local and systemic reactions were common whereas serious adverse events were rare (4). To characterize the safety of a third mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose among children aged 6 months–5 years, CDC reviewed adverse events and health surveys reported to v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based U.S. safety surveillance system established by CDC to monitor health after COVID-19 vaccination (https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a U.S. passive vaccine safety surveillance system co-managed by CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (https://vaers.hhs.gov/) (5). During June 17, 2022–May 7, 2023, approximately 495,576 children aged 6 months–4 years received a third dose (monovalent or bivalent) of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 63,919 children aged 6 months–5 years received a third dose of Moderna vaccine.† A third mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was recorded for 2,969 children in v-safe; approximately 37.7% had no reported reactions, and among those for whom reactions were reported, most reactions were mild and transient. VAERS received 536 reports after a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for children in these age groups; 98.5% of reports were nonserious and most (78.4%) were classified as a vaccination error.§ No new safety concerns were identified. Preliminary safety findings after a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6 months–5 years are similar to those after other doses. Health care providers can counsel parents and guardians of young children that most reactions reported after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine were mild and transient and that serious adverse events are rare.
Starting June 19, 2022, parents could enroll children aged 6 months–4 years in v-safe after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.¶ A parent with a v-safe account could register a child or adolescent aged <16 years, receive text message reminders, and complete health surveys on behalf of the child.** Health surveys sent daily during the week after vaccination inquire about local injection site and systemic reactions and health impacts; respondents can provide additional information via free-text responses. CDC’s v-safe call center contacts registrants who report receiving medical care to request more information; registrants are encouraged to complete a VAERS report, if indicated.
VAERS accepts reports of postvaccination adverse events from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public.†† Signs, symptoms, and diagnoses reported to VAERS are assigned Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs) by VAERS staff members.§§
This report includes data for children aged 6 months–5 years who received a third mRNA COVID-19 dose during June 17, 2022–May 7, 2023.¶¶ Local and systemic reactions and health impacts reported during the week after vaccination were described for v-safe registrants aged 6 months–5 years. VAERS reports were described by serious and nonserious classification, demographic characteristics, and MedDRA PTs. Serious reports*** and reports not specifying vaccination error were reviewed by CDC physicians to form a consensus clinical impression based on available data. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). These activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†††

Review of v-safe Data
During June 17, 2022–May 7, 2023, a total of 2,969 v-safe registrants aged 6 months–5 years received a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and had at least one health survey completed; l,082 aged 6 months–2 years and 823 aged 3–4 years received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 580 aged 6 months–2 years and 484 aged 3–5 years received Moderna vaccine. Concomitant receipt of another vaccine was reported for 437 (22.9%) children who received Pfizer-BioNTech and 66 (6.2%) who received Moderna; most (423; 84.1%) children received co-administered influenza vaccine.
Local and systemic reactions reported after receipt of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were most commonly reported (930; 53.2%) on the day after vaccination; 1,119 (37.7%) children had no reported reactions (Table 1). Local reactions were reported for 215 (19.9%) children aged 6 months–2 years and 304 (36.9%) aged 3–4 years after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination and for 179 (30.9%) aged 6 months–2 years and 252 (52.1%) aged 3–5 years after Moderna vaccination. Systemic reactions were reported for 617 (57.0%) children aged 6 months–2 years and for 361 (43.9%) children aged 3–4 years after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination, and for 309 (53.3%) children aged 6 months–2 years and for 229 (47.3%) children aged 3–5 years after Moderna vaccination. The most commonly reported reactions after receipt of either vaccine among children aged 6 months–2 years were irritability or crying, injection site pain, sleepiness, and fever (Table 2). Among children aged 3–5 years, the most frequently reported reactions were injection site pain, fatigue, and fever. Most reactions were described as mild in severity (noticeable, but not problematic).
Parents of 211 (7.1%) children aged 6 months–5 years reported at least once during the week after vaccination that their child was unable to perform normal daily activities, including 126 Pfizer BioNTech recipients and 85 Moderna recipients (Table 1); 90 (3.0%) parents reported seeking medical care for their child. Among these, 61 (67.8%) reported that care was received in an outpatient clinic; one child was hospitalized for pneumonia; 43 (48.0%) had additional information available from the v-safe call center. Parents of 30 children indicated that medical care was unrelated to vaccination, 11 parents completed a VAERS report, and two parents indicated that the report was made in error. Symptoms or signs of infection (e.g., cough, conjunctivitis, or hand-foot-and-mouth disease rash) were reported via free text or VAERS report for 34 of the 90 reports of medical care.

Review of VAERS Data
During June 17, 2022–May 7, 2023, VAERS received and processed 407 reports of adverse events among children aged 6 months–4 years after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 129 reports for children aged 6 months–5 years after Moderna vaccine (Table 3).§§§ Most reports were for children who received COVID-19 vaccine without concomitantly administered vaccines (487; 90.9%).
The most common events reported (420; 78.4%) were vaccination errors (e.g., incorrect product formulation administered, inappropriate schedule of product administration, expired product administered, or incorrect dose administered). Among 330 reports of vaccination errors after administration of Pfizer-BioNTech and 90 after Moderna vaccines, 27 (5.0%) reports indicated that an adverse health event had occurred.
After the exclusion of reports specifying vaccination error, 108 nonserious reports remained, including 71 after Pfizer-BioNTech and 37 after Moderna vaccination. After review, the most commonly reported nonserious events included infection¶¶¶ (57; 52.8%), no adverse event (13; 12.0%), and rash (nine; 8.3%).
Eight (1.5%) serious reports were made to VAERS: six for children who received Pfizer-BioNTech and two for children who received Moderna. Clinical impressions of the serious reports included acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy (infection with non–SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus), diabetic ketoacidosis (following new onset of diabetes mellitus type 1), Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Kawasaki disease, new-onset afebrile seizure (two), pneumonia, and viral exacerbation of asthma. After review of all available information, no evidence suggested that these reported events were related to vaccination.

Discussion
This report provides findings from v-safe and VAERS for children aged 6 months–5 years who received a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during June 17, 2022–May 7, 2023; during this period, approximately 559,495 third doses were administered to children in this age group. The findings in this report are consistent with those from postauthorization safety surveillance of the first 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Systemic reactions after receipt of the first or second doses were more commonly reported for children aged 6 months–2 years than for those aged 3–5 years; 44.7% of VAERS reports included at least one vaccination error (4).
Reports to v-safe of injection site and systemic reactions after a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were similar in frequency to those reported after a first (19.0%–32.4% reports of injection reaction and 32.2%–55.8% reports of systemic reaction) or second dose (18.3%–47.1% reports of injection reaction and 29.2%–58.2% reports of systemic reaction) among children aged 6 months–5 years (4). They were less frequent than those reported for children aged 5–11 years after a monovalent or bivalent booster dose (6,7). Approximately 38% of parents reported to v-safe that their child experienced no reactions in the week after a third mRNA vaccine dose. Most parents of children who received medical care reported that care was unrelated to vaccination. Many children who received medical care had signs and symptoms of an acute infection.
After administration of approximately 550,000 third doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 6 months–5 years, eight serious reports were received by VAERS. More than 98.0% of reports were nonserious; most represented vaccination errors (78.4%). Vaccination errors have constituted a large proportion of VAERS reports among children. For example, 85.0% of VAERS reports for children aged 5–11 years after bivalent booster vaccination were related to vaccination error (7). Among reports not specifying vaccination error, one half were of an unrelated infection. Recent ACIP recommendations simplifying guidance for bivalent vaccination might reduce reports of vaccination error (3).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, v-safe is a voluntary program; as a result, data might not be representative of the vaccinated population. Second, VAERS is a passive reporting system and is subject to reporting biases and underreporting, especially of nonserious events (5). Third, this report combined data for monovalent and bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine formulations. However, findings among older children did not differ by formulation (7). Finally, interpretation of these data is limited by the short surveillance period and small denominator of vaccinated children aged 6 months–5 years.
All children aged 6 months–5 years are recommended to receive at least 1 bivalent dose and might need multiple COVID-19 vaccine doses depending on their age and COVID-19 vaccination history**** (3). No new safety findings were identified among children aged 6 months–5 years after receipt of a third dose. Most reported reactions after vaccination were mild and transient. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection among young children typically results in mild infection, it can result in serious illness, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, long-term sequalae, and death (8). mRNA COVID-19 vaccination provides protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 4 months after vaccination among children aged 3–5 years (9). CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates to help guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.

* On June 17, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to include monovalent (mRNA encoding the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain) formulations of Pfizer-BioNTech (administered as 3 doses for children aged 6 months–4 years) and Moderna vaccines (administered as 2 doses for children aged 6 months–5 years) for younger children. On December 8, 2022, FDA amended EUAs for both manufacturers to include bivalent (mRNA encoding the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and BA.4/BA.5 Omicron variants) formulations for both age groups. EUAs for both manufacturers have since been amended regarding bivalent doses; ACIP guidance has changed to reflect these updates.

¶ On May 19, 2023, CDC closed enrollment in v-safe for COVID-19 vaccines. Health check-ins (and follow-up calls, if needed) for any doses added before May 19 will continue until June 30, 2023.
** Health check-ins are sent via text messages that link to web-based surveys on days 0–7 after vaccination; then weekly through 6 weeks after vaccination; and then 3, 6, and 12 months after vaccination. Specific questions were included for children aged 6 months–2 years who might not be able to describe reactions or who might experience reactions that differ from those experienced by children aged ≥3 years. Parents use the following definitions to describe the severity of a child’s symptoms: mild (noticeable, but not problematic), moderate (limit normal daily activities), or severe (make daily activities difficult or impossible). V-safe also sends text-message reminders when a person is eligible for their next vaccine dose; an additional reminder was sent on March 21, 2023, to parents of children who were eligible for a booster dose but had not reported one.
†† Under EUA regulations, health care providers are required to report certain adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, including vaccination errors and death (https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html). VAERS forms ask for patient, vaccine, administration, and adverse event information. https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS%202.0_Checklist.pdf
§§ Each VAERS report might be assigned more than one MedDRA PT. A MedDRA-coded event does not indicate a medically confirmed diagnosis. https://www.meddra.org/how-to-use/basics/hierarchy
¶¶ Data for v-safe were included for children aged 6 months–4 years who received a third Pfizer-BioNTech dose during June 17, 2022–May 7, 2023, and for children aged 6 months–5 years who received a third Moderna dose during June 17, 2022–February 26, 2023. Reports to VAERS were included for children aged 6 months–4 years who received a third monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech dose during June 17, 2022–May 7, 2023, or bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech dose during December 8, 2022–May 7, 2023, and for children aged 6 months–5 years who received a third monovalent Moderna dose during June 17, 2022–May 7, 2023, or bivalent Moderna dose during December 8, 2022–May 7, 2023.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Vaccination efforts during the 2022 U.S. monkeypox (mpox) outbreak focused on populations at elevated risk for acquiring mpox.
What is added by this report?
As of April 2023, two thirds (approximately 66.0%) of mpox vaccine–eligible persons remained unvaccinated. The shortfall (difference between 100% coverage and reported first-dose coverage) was largest among Black or African American (Black) persons (77.9%). The largest monthly decreases in overall shortfall were in August (17.7%) and September (8.5%). However, during these months, smaller shortfall reductions were achieved among Black persons (12.2% and 4.9%, respectively).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Vaccination coverage among racial and ethnic minority groups with the largest shortfalls needs to increase substantially to reduce disparities in vaccination coverage and increase health equity.

More than 30,000 monkeypox (mpox) cases were reported in the United States during the 2022 multinational outbreak; cases disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Substantial racial and ethnic disparities in incidence were also reported (1). The national mpox vaccination strategy* emphasizes that efforts to administer the JYNNEOS mpox vaccine should be focused among the populations at elevated risk for exposure to mpox (2). During May 2022–April 2023, a total of 748,329 first JYNNEOS vaccine doses (of the two recommended) were administered in the United States.† During the initial months of the outbreak, lower vaccination coverage rates among racial and ethnic minority groups were reported (1,3); however, after implementation of initiatives developed to expand access to mpox vaccination,§ coverage among racial and ethnic minority groups increased (1,4). A shortfall analysis was conducted to examine whether the increase in mpox vaccination coverage was equitable across all racial and ethnic groups (5). Shortfall was defined as the percentage of the vaccine-eligible population that did not receive the vaccine (i.e., 100% minus the percentage of the eligible population that did receive a first dose). Monthly mpox vaccination shortfalls were calculated and were stratified by race and ethnicity; monthly percent reductions in shortfall were also calculated compared with the preceding month’s shortfall (6). The mpox vaccination shortfall decreased among all racial and ethnic groups during May 2022–April 2023; however, based on analysis of vaccine administration data with race and ethnicity reported, 66.0% of vaccine-eligible persons remained unvaccinated at the end of this period. The shortfall was largest among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (77.9%) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (74.5%) persons, followed by non-Hispanic White (White) (66.6%) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (63.0%) persons, and was lowest among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) (38.5%) and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) (43.7%) persons. The largest percentage decreases in the shortfall were achieved during August (17.7%) and September (8.5%). However, during these months, smaller percentage decreases were achieved among Black persons (12.2% and 4.9%, respectively), highlighting the need for a focus on equity for the entirety of a public health response. Achieving equitable progress in JYNNEOS vaccination coverage will require substantial decreases in shortfalls among Black and AI/AN persons.
Shortfall analysis, an approach that focuses on the percentage of persons who have not achieved a certain health outcome (5), was used to quantify progress in mpox vaccination overall and by racial and ethnic groups. Unlike many conventional disparity measures that compare the rate of a particular health outcome in racial and ethnic minority groups with the rate of another group, such as the group with most favorable rate or the overall population (7), shortfall analysis does not require a comparison group. Thus, the shortfall analysis can quantify progress in mpox vaccination coverage for any given racial or ethnic group without regard to changes in vaccination coverage in a comparison group. Further, comparisons of shortfalls across racial and ethnic groups can help to determine if progress in mpox vaccination coverage is equitable. Shortfall in mpox vaccination was calculated as 100% minus the percentage of the eligible population that received a first dose of mpox vaccine; thus, the shortfall measure reflects the deficit in the percentage of vaccinated persons in the eligible population from 100% coverage. Shortfalls, and decreases in shortfalls (measured as a percentage), were calculated at monthly intervals during May 2022–April 2023 for each racial and ethnic group (6). A reduction in shortfall indicates progress specific to an individual racial and ethnic group without the need for a reference group, because the reference point is 100% coverage (6). Shortfall analyses have been used for measuring progress for a range of health outcomes, such as increases in life expectancies (6).
Data on the number of persons aged ≥13 years among seven racial and ethnic groups¶ who received a first dose of mpox vaccine were obtained from case surveillance reports submitted to CDC by 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, during May 2022–April 2023.** The size of the eligible population was calculated as 125% of the sum of the estimated number of MSM with HIV and the estimated number of MSM with HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) indications. The 25% increase was to account for additional persons who are more likely to be exposed: MSM who are at increased risk for mpox but do not have indications for HIV PrEP; cisgender female, transgender, and gender nonbinary persons who are partners of MSM; close contacts of persons with known or suspected mpox; and persons at risk for occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses (8). Estimates of the number of MSM with HIV by race and ethnicity and the estimates of MSM with HIV PrEP indications were obtained using data from CDC Atlas Plus.†† To estimate the number of MSM with HIV PrEP indications by race and ethnicity,§§ the racial and ethnic distribution of MSM with HIV PrEP indications was assumed to be the same as the racial and ethnic distribution of the male population in the United States.¶¶ (9). Analyses were conducted using R statistical software (version 4.2.1; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***
Based on review of vaccination data with race and ethnicity reported, an estimated 34.0% of the eligible population had received a first dose of JYNNEOS vaccine by the end of April 2023, corresponding to a calculated shortfall of 66.0% (Table 1). The first dose coverage shortfall was larger among Black (77.9%) and AI/AN (74.5%) persons than among White (66.6%), Hispanic (63.0%), Asian (38.5%), and NH/OPI (43.7%) persons (Figure).
From June to July, the overall reduction in shortfall was modest (5.5%), with the smallest reductions observed among Black and AI/AN persons (2.8% each) (Table 2). The largest overall mpox vaccination shortfall reductions were achieved from July to August (17.7%) and August to September (8.5%). However, during these periods, larger shortfall reductions were observed in White (17.1% and 8.3%, respectively), Hispanic (19.2% and 9.3%, respectively), Asian (34.0% and 20.0%, respectively), and NH/OPI (30.8% and 17.5%, respectively) persons, and smaller reductions occurred among Black (12.2% and 4.9%, respectively) and AI/AN (10.5% and 7.5%, respectively) persons. Overall shortfall reductions were smaller from October to November (1.6%), November to December (0.8%), December to January (0.5%), and March to April (0.2%).

Discussion
During May 2022–April 2023, the shortfalls in receipt of a first dose of mpox vaccine by the eligible population were reduced among all racial and ethnic groups; however, the shortfall was larger among Black and AI/AN persons. The finding of a larger shortfall among Black persons is consistent with the findings of a previous report, which found that the higher vaccination rate among Black males relative to White males (rate ratio = 1.2) was not commensurate with the higher mpox incidence in Black males (rate ratio = 5.8) (1). Compared with White persons, Black persons are approximately 20% more likely to be vaccinated (1), but they are also approximately 83% more likely than White persons to be members of the vaccine-eligible population. Thus, despite the slightly higher vaccination rate among Black persons,††† the vaccine shortfall is larger among Black persons. The decrease in shortfall was modest from June to July and was most notable in August and September, which could be related to an increase in vaccine supply resulting from the recommendation for dose-sparing intradermal administration of JYNNEOS vaccine on August 9, 2022,§§§ and expanded vaccination initiatives, including a focus on addressing disparities in vaccination coverage (4). Further, the shortfall among Hispanic persons was less than the overall shortfall, which could also be a consequence of the focus on health equity in the expanded vaccination initiatives (1). However, the shortfall reductions were not consistent across all racial and ethnic groups, with smaller reductions among Black and AI/AN populations.
The monthly shortfall reduction is likely a more meaningful measure of progress toward equity in vaccination coverage than is the increase in vaccination coverage, because the former quantifies progress toward 100% mpox vaccination, and the latter can be biased against racial and ethnic groups with lower coverage (i.e., the same percentage point increase in coverage will result in a larger relative percent increase among groups with lower coverage than in groups with higher coverage) (5). Accordingly, the decline in shortfall is consistent with the principle of proportional justice, in which equitable progress toward 100% vaccination requires that racial and ethnic minority groups with larger vaccination shortfalls achieve larger percentage point increases in vaccination coverage than do groups with smaller shortfalls (5,6). Focusing on the racial and ethnic groups with larger mpox vaccination shortfalls and prioritizing resources and improving access to vaccination for these groups can reduce the overall shortfall in mpox vaccination while simultaneously promoting health equity.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data on race and ethnicity were missing for 9% of vaccine recipients; if vaccinated persons with missing race and ethnicity data were included in the analysis, the overall shortfall would be 62.5% rather than 66.0% (8). Second, the estimated sizes of racial and ethnic groups constituting the vaccine-eligible population are uncertain (8). For example, the racial and ethnic distribution of MSM with HIV PrEP indications is unknown; for this analysis, this distribution was assumed to be the same as the that of the U.S. male population, based on the evidence of similar levels of HIV PrEP indications across racial and ethnic groups (9). However, the actual racial and ethnic disparities in mpox vaccination shortfall could be notably higher than estimated if there are racial and ethnic disparities in the distribution of MSM with HIV PrEP indications¶¶¶ (10). Finally, estimates of the size of the vaccine-eligible population were increased by 25% to include additional groups (other than MSM with HIV or MSM with HIV PrEP indications) who might benefit from vaccination. However, the need to expand the size of the vaccine-eligible population might be more pronounced for racial and ethnic minority groups because of social determinants of health and sexual partnership selection patterns based on race and ethnicity (e.g., persons tending to choose sexual partners of same race and ethnicity, age, and other characteristics). Accordingly, the vaccination shortfalls might be underestimated, particularly for some racial and ethnic minority groups.
This mpox vaccination shortfall analysis provides a better understanding of progress in mpox vaccination in eligible populations by racial and ethnic groups than assessing increases in percentage of persons vaccinated. The shortfall reductions among Black and AI/AN persons were smaller than the overall shortfall reductions at all monthly intervals considered, leading to larger and persistently higher shortfalls in these groups compared with overall shortfall. A focus on achieving equal reductions in shortfalls is needed to achieve equitable progress in mpox vaccination coverage. Effective strategies could include engaging trusted messengers, community-based organizations, and providers in the design and delivery of vaccination messages using relatable cultural and language nuances to reach populations at increased risk for mpox.**** To minimize the risk for future mpox outbreaks, vaccination coverage among all eligible persons needs to increase substantially, particularly among racial and ethnic minority groups with the largest shortfalls.

†† The estimated number of MSM with HIV by race and ethnicity was obtained from jurisdiction-specific estimates of 2020 HIV prevalence by race and ethnicity from Atlas Plus (an interactive tool that allows for the creation of customized tables, maps and charts using CDC’s HIV, hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis surveillance data) describing men with HIV whose HIV transmission category was male-to-male sexual contact or male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use. https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/atlas/index.htm
§§ The number of MSM with indications for HIV PrEP was estimated as the ratio of the jurisdiction-specific number of MSM receiving HIV PrEP and the jurisdiction-specific HIV PrEP coverage from CDC’s Atlas Plus. The number of MSM with indications for HIV PrEP by race and ethnicity was estimated by multiplying the number of MSM with HIV PrEP indications by the race and ethnicity weights derived from the racial and ethnic distribution of the male population in the United States. https://wonder.cdc.gov/single-race-v2021.html
¶¶ This approach was employed based on the evidence indicating that the proportion of MSM reporting HIV PrEP indications was similar across racial and ethnic groups. A supplemental analysis was conducted in which the racial and ethnic distribution of MSM with HIV PrEP indications was assumed to be the same as the racial and ethnic distribution of new HIV diagnoses in MSM using data from CDC’s Atlas Plus.

††† The probability that a Black person would be in the vaccine-eligible population was calculated as the number of Black persons in the vaccine-eligible population divided by the number of Black persons aged ≥13 years in the United States (382,876 / 34,715,303 = 0.011), using 2021 population estimates from CDC wonder (https://wonder.cdc.gov/single-race-single-year-v2021.html). Using the same approach, the probability that a White person would be in the vaccine-eligible population was calculated as 1,036,538 / 171,591,284 = 0.006. The relative likelihood of a Black person being in the vaccine-eligible population compared with a White person was 1.83 (0.011 / 0.006).

¶¶¶ In the supplemental analysis in which the racial and ethnic distribution of MSM with HIV PrEP indications was assumed to be the same as the racial and ethnic distribution of new HIV diagnoses in MSM, the shortfalls in vaccination as of April 2023 for the three largest racial and ethnic groups were Black, 87.8% (versus 77.9% in the main analysis); Hispanic, 72.0% (versus 63.0%); and White, 44.4% (versus 66.6%). However, the overall shortfall was the same in both analyses (66.0%).

During May 17–December 31, 2022, 125 probable or confirmed U.S. monkeypox (mpox)† cases were reported among patients aged <18 years, including 45 (36%) in children aged ≤12 years. Eighty-three cases in persons aged <18 years diagnosed during May 17–September 24, 2022 were previously described (1); 28 (34%) of these were in children aged ≤12 years, 29% of whom did not have reported information on exposure. Among 20 (71%) of 28 patients with documented information on exposure, most were exposed by a household contact. This report updates the previous report using data collected during September 25–December 31, 2022, proposes possible mpox exposure routes in children aged ≤12 years, and describes three U.S. mpox cases in neonates. Household members or caregivers with mpox, including pregnant women and their health care providers, should be informed of the risk of transmission to persons aged <18 years, and strategies to protect persons aged <18 years at risk for exposure, including isolating household contacts with mpox, should be implemented immediately.
During September 25–December 31, 2022, 17 children aged ≤12 years with probable or confirmed mpox were identified through national surveillance. CDC provided a questionnaire to state and local health departments for collection of the child’s history of exposure to any person with mpox§ during the previous 3 weeks, exposure settings, types of contact (e.g., skin-to-skin, being held or cuddled, diaper change, or toilet use), and precautions taken by the person with mpox (e.g., practiced isolation or covered lesions). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶
Three of the 17 pediatric patients were aged ≤7 days and had likely perinatal exposures; all three neonates were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black). Two of these three mpox cases in neonates were previously reported (2). Ten of the remaining children were aged 0–4 years, and four children were aged 5–12 years. Nine patients were boys, and five were girls; nine were Black, two were Hispanic or Latino, and three were non-Hispanic White. Seven of the children aged 0–4 years, and two of those aged 5–12 years had known exposure to a person with mpox (Table); in five cases, the exposure source was unknown. Six of the seven children aged 0–4 years and both children aged 5–12 years known to be exposed to mpox were exposed by a caregiver or a household contact. Five of nine children with known exposure to a person with mpox were reported to have had close physical contact; notably, four of five children aged 0–4 years had skin-to-skin contact. Five of the nine children were exposed to a person with mpox who reported taking at least one precaution, including four persons who reported isolating. Two of these household contacts reported sharing a bed, bedroom, or bathroom with the child. Evidence suggests persons with mpox might transmit the virus up to 4 days before symptom onset (3); review of children’s case histories suggest that in at least three cases, the person with mpox (i.e., the exposure source) did not begin isolating until after had they received a diagnosis.
This report includes the first three U.S. mpox cases reported in newborns in the 2022 outbreak; these cases were not included in the earlier report of cases of diagnosed persons aged <18 years during May 17–September 24, 2022, (1) but two of the cases were included in a subsequent report (2). Among children aged ≤12 years with mpox who had a known exposure to a person with mpox, the majority were exposed by household contacts or caregivers with mpox, consistent with previous findings (1). This report describes precautions taken by persons with mpox to whom pediatric patients were exposed. Not all persons with mpox reported taking precautions, and children might have been exposed to mpox before initiation of precautions. As described in a recent case report of mpox in a toddler (4), precautions taken might not have been sufficient to prevent transmission from caregivers to children.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because timing of initiation of precautions relative to exposure was not collected, and the number of children and infants who did not acquire mpox after exposure is unknown, effectiveness of specific precautions could not be evaluated. Second, because pediatric infections during the 2022 outbreak were rare, the sample size is small, and generalizability is limited. Third, it is not possible to investigate racial disparity of mpox cases among children and in adults because of the small number of mpox cases among children. Finally, for some cases, exposure histories might be affected by misclassification because of recall error or social desirability bias.
This report adds to the information about mpox among children during the 2022 outbreak (5). Early diagnosis and implementation of infection control measures are critical to reducing transmission of mpox to children and infants. Household members or caregivers with mpox, including pregnant women and their health care providers, should be informed of transmission risks to children and infants. Protecting children at risk for mpox exposure requires that exposure prevention strategies be implemented without delay. These strategies include isolating household contacts with mpox, preventing contact among adults and children with mpox and other household members, ensuring persons with mpox aged >2 years wear a mask when possible, and limiting the number of persons caring for a child with an mpox infection. When caring for the child with mpox, direct contact with the child’s rash should be avoided and gloves should be worn. In addition, postexposure prophylaxis should be considered for all members of the household.

Local transmission of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was first reported in the Americas during December 2013, followed by widespread regional transmission (1). CHIKV is transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Most infected persons (72%–97%) experience symptomatic illness, typically including fever and often severe polyarthralgia (which can persist for months or years) (2). Rare complications include neurologic, cardiac, or renal disease (2).
Paraguay reported its first autochthonous chikungunya case during 2015 (3). The subsequent outbreak, concentrated in the capital city of Asunción and the neighboring Central Department, resulted in 5,221 cases during 2015–2016.* A second outbreak (1,239 cases) occurred during 2018 in the north-central Amambay Department. Beginning the first week of October 2022, an increase in reported cases was again noted; this report provides preliminary information on this outbreak as of March 11, 2023.
During October 1, 2022–March 11, 2023, a total of 81,037 suspected, probable, or confirmed† chikungunya cases was recorded by the Paraguayan Ministry of Health§; among these, 75,911 (94%) occurred during 2023. Most cases occurred in Central Department (49,070; 61%) and Asunción (16,094; 20%). Cumulative national incidence was 1,073 cases per 100,000 population (3,088 per 100,000 population in Asunción).¶ Weekly case counts in Asunción and Central Department declined slightly after epidemiologic week 6, but an increasing number and proportion of cases were subsequently reported from outlying regions, including along borders with Brazil and Argentina.
Among 47,116 probable or confirmed cases,** 27,147 (58%) were in females, and the median age was 36 years (range = 0 days–103 years); 4,604 (10%) hospitalizations and 52 (<1%) deaths attributable to CHIKV infection were reported.†† Among 208 (0.4%) cases in infants aged ≤29 days (neonates), 140 hospitalizations and eight deaths were reported,§§ accounting for the highest case fatality rate (3.8%) among all age groups (Figure). Among fatal neonatal cases, the timing of symptom onset suggested intrapartum transmission in 75% and mosquitoborne transmission in 25%.¶¶ Among adults aged ≥60 years, 10,617 cases and 1,878 hospitalizations (41% of all hospitalizations) were reported. Within this group, 32 deaths occurred***; 23 (72%) and 13 (41%) decedents had documented cardiovascular disease and diabetes, respectively, and 20 (63%) had two or more comorbidities. The highest case fatality rate among adults aged ≥60 years occurred among those aged ≥80 years (0.6%; 11 of 1,719 cases).
CHIKV can cause explosive outbreaks and substantial morbidity in all age groups. Groups at risk for severe disease and death include older adults, persons with comorbidities, and infants. Prevention messages should focus on avoiding mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, using insect repellents, screening windows and doors, and covering cribs, strollers, and beds with netting. Mosquito breeding sites around homes should be eliminated by emptying, scrubbing, or covering water-holding containers. In addition, integrated vector surveillance and control measures are essential at the community level. Persons with suspected infection should prevent mosquito bites to reduce spread to others. These measures will also reduce the risk for infection from dengue and Zika viruses, which often co-circulate; dengue virus is currently co-circulating in Paraguay.
No antiviral treatment for chikungunya exists; however, timely dissemination of diagnosis and management guidance is crucial.††† Newborns with possible intrapartum exposure should be monitored in a hospital during the first week of life, because deterioration can occur rapidly (4). Infection prevention measures should be implemented in hospitals to limit spread to staff members and patients, including providing bed nets and repellent for inpatients with chikungunya and eliminating mosquito breeding sites from hospital grounds.
Humans are the primary reservoir during epidemics and can transport the virus to new areas; cases in travelers returning from Paraguay have been reported in several countries§§§ (5). If an infected person is bitten by a mosquito vector at their destination, a risk for local transmission exists. During 2022–2023, in the Americas, increases in chikungunya cases and spread outside historical transmission areas (e.g., Uruguay and parts of Argentina) have occurred.¶¶¶ Strengthened surveillance and preparedness are crucial (5). Although no vaccine is currently licensed, several are in the late stages of development and could have a role in reducing cases and deaths in future outbreaks (2).

† On the basis of the Paraguayan Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare’s case definition, a suspected case is illness in a person with abrupt onset of a temperature ≥99.5°F (≥37.5°C) and incapacitating arthralgia or arthritis not explained by another medical condition, or in a neonate with fever, irritability, or cutaneous eruption. A probable case is a clinically compatible case with an epidemiologic link to a confirmed case or a positive CHIKV immunoglobulin (Ig) M test result. A confirmed case is any case with evidence of CHIKV infection determined by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing or virus isolation.
§ The number of suspected cases reported here excludes cases that were discarded on the basis of a negative RT-PCR test result <7 days, or a negative IgM test result ≥7 days, after symptom onset.
¶ Incidence calculated using 2023 population projections from the Paraguayan National Census. https://www.ine.gov.py/microdatos/index.php?cant=99&tema=TODOS
** Probable and confirmed cases were used to describe demographic and clinical findings because data were more complete.
†† Pediatric and adult mortality committees met weekly to review comprehensive clinical information on deaths of patients with probable or confirmed chikungunya and classify the cause of death as attributable to 1) CHIKV infection, or 2) another cause in a patient with concurrent CHIKV infection.
§§ An additional eight deaths of neonates with probable or confirmed chikungunya were determined not attributable to chikungunya, and eight deaths among suspected, probable, or confirmed cases were pending a review of cause of death or laboratory results to confirm infection.
¶¶ Among eight neonates who died, symptom onset after birth was <7 days for six cases and >14 days for two cases.
*** An additional 136 deaths among persons aged ≥60 years with probable or confirmed chikungunya were determined not attributable to chikungunya, and 163 deaths among suspected, probable, or confirmed cases were pending a review of cause of death or laboratory results to confirm infection.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). RVF is endemic throughout most of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and causes considerable morbidity and mortality among domestic livestock (1,2). Human infection occurs through contact with infected animals or their products or through bites from infected mosquitoes, mainly Aedes and Culex spp. (3). Human infections are typically asymptomatic or mild, usually manifesting as acute influenza-like illnesses (2). Severe disease, including hemorrhagic signs, occurs in approximately 10% of cases, nearly 10%–20% of which are fatal (2). Because of its socioeconomic impact and epidemic potential, RVF is a priority zoonotic disease in Uganda (4).
On February 4, 2023, the Uganda National Public Health Emergency Operations Center was notified of a suspected viral hemorrhagic fever case in a male abattoir worker and meat roaster aged 42 years from Mbarara City, the second largest city in Uganda. The patient was evaluated at a private health facility on January 30, at which time he reported a 2-day history of influenza-like illness. He received antimalarial medication and was discharged. On February 1, because of worsening signs and symptoms (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, difficulty breathing, and abdominal, chest, muscle, and joint pain), the patient sought treatment at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH). On February 3, he experienced nosebleed, gingival hemorrhage, hematuria, and bloody stools, and voluntarily left MRRH to seek care at a second, private facility. Suspecting a viral hemorrhagic fever, clinicians isolated him, provided supportive care, and referred him back to MRRH, where he died on February 4. A postmortem blood sample tested at the Uganda Virus Research Institute for any ebolavirus, marburgvirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and RVFV, was positive on February 5 for RVFV by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (5), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (3).
On February 7, the Mbarara District Task Force was activated to coordinate response efforts and was later joined by the National Rapid Response Team. A suspected RVF case was defined as the occurrence of fever with a negative malaria test and two or more signs or symptoms (headache, muscle pain, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea) in a resident of or a visitor to Mbarara during or after December 2022. A probable case was defined as death in a person with suspected RVF and a history of livestock contact who died without laboratory testing; a confirmed case was laboratory-confirmed by RVFV RT-PCR or IgM ELISA.
Reports of spontaneous bovine (i.e., cattle) abortions and deaths began in December 2022 after unusually heavy rains during September–November. Retrospective case finding in the community identified 102 suspected RVF cases and one probable case during January–March 2023. Twenty-four suspected cases were subsequently laboratory-confirmed, 17 (71%) by RT-PCR and seven (29%) by IgM ELISA. The confirmed (24) and probable (one) cases were identified from 11 villages within five subcounties in Mbarara District. Symptom onset dates ranged from January 11 to March 1, 2023 (Figure). Median patient age was 36 years (IQR = 26–42 years), and four (16%) patients died. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms were fever (25 cases, 100%), general weakness (18, 72%), loss of appetite (16, 64%), and joint pain (15, 60%). Cases were linked to six cattle farms and three abattoirs in the affected areas. All patients reported contact with cattle that had died suddenly or had recently aborted; 15 (60%) worked on a farm where cattle abortions were reported.
Seventeen (68%) patients sought care, including 14 (82%) who visited one facility and three who visited two or more facilities before receiving a confirmed diagnosis. Eight (47%) patients who sought care were hospitalized. The average illness duration was 9 days (range = 5–29 days) among the 21 survivors and 6 days (range = 4–7 days) among the four fatalities. All known survivors have clinically recovered. Public health response to this outbreak is ongoing.
No RVF vaccine for use in humans is currently licensed. Prevention of RVF in humans requires control in animals and measures such as thorough cooking of meat and milk before consumption, use of personal protective equipment to avoid exposure to blood or tissues of infected animals, and protection against mosquitoes, and other blood-sucking insects. Vaccination is essential for prevention of animal RVFV infection; however, although the animal vaccine is approved for use in neighboring Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania, it has not yet been approved for use in Uganda. Enhanced vector control and improved health care provider, veterinary, and community education are urgently needed to improve surveillance and awareness on the ongoing threat of viral hemorrhagic fevers in humans and animals in Uganda.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Community water fluoridation delivers cavity-preventing fluoride to everyone with access. The U.S. government sets optimal fluoridation at 0.7 mg/L and a safety standard at 2.0 mg/L.
What is being added by this report?
During 2016–2021, a total of 4,080 community water systems safely fluoridated water 99.99% of the time, with levels below the secondary safety standard of 2.0 mg/L. However, 16.3% of nearly 8 billion population-weighted monthly fluoride measurements were <0.6 mg/L, placing the prevention of cavities in jeopardy.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Water system managers are encouraged to work with their state programs to report fluoride data to CDC and meet U.S. Public Health Service recommendations to provide the full benefit of cavity prevention through water fluoridation.

Drinking water fluoridated at the level recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) reduces dental caries (cavities) by approximately 25% in children and adults (1). USPHS recommends fluoride levels to achieve oral health benefits and minimize risks associated with excess fluoride exposure. To provide the benefits of community water fluoridation, water systems should target a level of 0.7 mg/L and maintain levels ≥0.6 mg/L (2). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets a safety standard at 2.0 mg/L to prevent mild or moderate dental fluorosis, a condition that causes changes in the appearance of tooth enamel caused by hypermineralization resulting from excess fluoride intake during tooth-forming years (i.e., before age 8 years). During 2016–2021, fluoride measurements for 16.3% of population-weighted monthly fluoride measurements (person-months) reported by community water systems to CDC’s Water Fluoridation Reporting System (WFRS) were <0.6 mg/L; only 0.01% of person-months exceeded 2.0 mg/L. More than 80% of population-weighted fluoride measurements from community water systems reporting to WFRS were above 0.6 mg/L. Although 0.7 mg/L is the recommended optimal level, ≥0.6 mg/L is still effective for the prevention of caries. A total of 4,080 community water systems safely fluoridated water 99.99% of the time with levels below the secondary safety standard of 2.0 mg/L. Water systems are encouraged to work with their state programs to report their fluoride data into WFRS and meet USPHS recommendations to provide the full benefit of fluoridation for caries prevention.
Monthly data from WFRS during 2016–2021 were analyzed for water systems that added fluoride (adjusting systems); these systems provide monthly average fluoride levels in mg/L. These monthly average fluoride levels were compared for two goals: prevention and safety. For prevention, reported levels were compared with 0.7 mg/L, the USPHS-recommended optimal fluoride level for preventing caries (3). For safety (i.e., to minimize potential fluorosis)* (4), reported fluoride levels were compared with the EPA’s secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL), of 2.0 mg/L. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.1.3; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
Water system populations were obtained from WFRS for each year during 2016–2021 (5). These populations are updated periodically by the states directly to WFRS or annually by CDC from EPA’s State Drinking Water Information System. Population-weighted monthly fluoride levels (person-months) were calculated by multiplying each average monthly fluoride level by the size of the population served by each water system.
Data are typically reported to WFRS on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. Participation across states varies based on fluoride-reporting requirements, drinking water or oral health program staffing limitations, and fluoridation program funding status. Among approximately 54,000 water systems in WFRS, a total of 5,888 adjust fluoride levels and serve a population of more than 200 million persons (145 million directly and an additional 55 million through water systems that purchase fluoridated water from adjusted water systems). Among the systems in WFRS, a total of 4,080, serving a population of 124,616,896, provided at least 1 month of data during the study period. Among 7,936,442,898 person-months during 2016–2021, only 796,283 (0.01%) exceeded the SMCL§; 16.3% were below 0.6 mg/L, and 83.7% of person-months operated between 0.6 mg/L and 2.0 mg/L with the largest peak in data at the 0.7 mg/L target (Figure).

Discussion
In this examination of the performance of U.S. water systems reporting fluoride levels from the perspectives of preventing caries and supporting established safety standards, the most common person-month fluoride level was the USPHS-recommended level of 0.7 mg/L and fluoride levels rarely exceeded the SMCL (0.01%). SMCL exceedances should be minimized to reduce dental fluorosis. Dental caries are one of the most common preventable chronic diseases among U.S. children: approximately one in four children living below the federal poverty level experiences untreated caries (6). Optimal levels of water fluoridation prevent caries by providing frequent and consistent contact with low levels of fluoride, ultimately reducing tooth decay by 25% in children and adults (7). Water systems that consistently and optimally fluoridate support the reduction of tooth decay. Suboptimal water systems in which fluoride concentrations are <0.6 mg/L are both ineffective in using resources and in supporting the oral health of their communities. Optimal fluoridation can be maintained with routine maintenance and monitoring, which provide protection from equipment malfunction, disruptions in fluoride supply, and periodic system shutdowns.¶
Water fluoridation promotes health equity through its proven effects on decreasing caries, reducing costs to families, and being readily available at the tap. In light of these benefits, Healthy People 2030, an ongoing initiative to improve population health, set the objective to increase the proportion of U.S. residents served by optimally fluoridated water systems to 77.1% from 73.0% in 2018 (8). Currently, programs nationwide receive a net savings of $6.5 billion per year by averting direct dental treatment costs (tooth restorations and extractions) and indirect costs (follow-up treatment and losses of productivity) (9). After community water fluoridation was discontinued in Juneau, Alaska, for example, a higher number of caries-related procedures among persons aged <18 years was documented, particularly in persons born after cessation of fluoridation, highlighting the long-term oral health benefits of supporting access to fluoridated water (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, CDC relies on state oral health and drinking water programs to report operational information; 31% of adjusting systems (5,888) did not report any fluoride levels during 2016–2021. Second, population values for all water systems are obtained from EPA’s State Drinking Water Information System federal database at the state’s discretion; however, additions and deletions of water systems and associated fluoridation status must be received from the state programs. As a result, counts of water system and information might differ from other publicly available community water system databases. Reporting in WFRS might be increased by improving data sharing between state drinking water and oral health programs, especially in states where water system data are entered into WFRS by the oral health program. Methods to increase reporting can include creating a data-sharing memorandum of understanding between the two programs and implementing a state policy that requires water systems to conduct monthly recording and reporting to the state.
Thousands of fluoride-adjusting community water systems reach approximately 200 million persons in the United States. To promote receipt of the full benefits of community water fluoridation, water systems must manage resources to meet the established 0.7 mg/L target consistently, especially those serving communities where fluoride measurements were <0.6 mg/L. CDC carefully and continuously monitors emerging research about the benefits and risks of fluoride exposure so that recommendations are evidence-based. CDC continues to emphasize the importance of community water fluoridation at the recommended level of 0.7 mg/L as the cornerstone of dental caries prevention in the United States.** Water systems are encouraged to work with their state programs to report their fluoride data into WFRS and meet USPHS recommendations to provide the full benefit of fluoride in caries prevention. Maintaining and improving access to optimally fluoridated water remains a vital, safe, and successful method for reducing dental caries and their associated costs for communities and families.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons are disproportionately affected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
What is added by this report?
Five years after implementing a hepatitis C elimination program, Cherokee Nation Health Services (CNHS) had diagnosed hepatitis C in 1,423 persons, 86% of whom were linked to care. Although only 61% initiated treatment, 99% of those who completed treatment were cured. Barriers to HCV treatment initiation include lack of access to direct-acting antivirals at the time of HCV evaluation.
What are the implications for public health practice?
CNHS’s Hepatitis C Elimination Program can be used as a model for other health systems serving AI/AN persons; however, barriers to HCV treatment initiation need to be addressed to achieve HCV elimination.

Approximately 2.4 million persons in the United States have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and 66,700 acute HCV infection cases were estimated for 2020 (1,2). American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons are disproportionately affected by HCV infection and experienced the highest rates of acute HCV infection (2.1 cases per 100,000 persons) and HCV-associated mortality (10.17 per 100,000 persons) in the United States during 2020 (1). During 2015, Cherokee Nation Health Services (CNHS) in Oklahoma implemented an HCV elimination program, which includes universal HCV screening, primary HCV workforce expansion, and harm reduction services (3). To assess progress 5 years after program initiation, CNHS analyzed deidentified health record data. During November 1, 2015–October 31, 2020, a total of 1,423 persons received a diagnosis of HCV infection. Among these persons, 1,227 (86.2%) were linked to HCV care, and 871 (61.2%) initiated HCV treatment; 702 (49.3%) returned for their 12-week post treatment completion visit, at which time 698 (49.1%) had achieved laboratory-confirmed sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA at ≥12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12). Although CNHS has linked the majority of persons diagnosed with HCV infection to care, and those who returned for the SVR12 visit had high cure rates (99.4%), treatment initiation was lower than expected. Future activities should prioritize addressing gaps in treatment initiation after linkage to care and confirmation of hepatitis C cure with SVR12 testing.
Cherokee Nation is the largest AI/AN nation in the United States, spanning 14 counties in Oklahoma and including more than 450,000 registered Cherokee citizens (4). CNHS is the largest tribally operated health system in the United States, providing health care for over 100,000 AI/AN persons in 11 health care facilities across the reservation (5). During 2015, CNHS initiated an HCV elimination program to improve HCV screening, treatment, and cure. CNHS has published cascades of care, which document the progression of persons through the stages of HCV care, from diagnosis to treatment and cure, beginning before and continuing through 22 months after the start of their program (3,6,7). This report describes the most comprehensive CNHS HCV cascade of care, including five years of program data.
To assess progress of the HCV elimination program, CNHS extracted and analyzed deidentified data collected through the CNHS electronic health record system and HCV treatment database. The reported cascade of care is based on a modified version of the Consensus HCV Cascade of Care* (7); treatment completion was not included in the cascade as a distinct stage of care, but completion of HCV treatment among those included in the cascade was assessed. Persons included in this analysis had HCV RNA detected during November 1, 2015–October 31, 2020, and were thought to be alive as of October 31, 2020. Records of persons who received a diagnosis of HCV infection before November 1, 2015, and who had not received treatment as of this date, were also included. SVR12 visit and results were included in the cascade of care when those outcomes occurred by April 30, 2021.
Diagnosis of HCV infection was defined as receipt of a detectable HCV RNA test result. Linkage to HCV care was defined as undergoing an evaluation by a CNHS HCV-trained provider. HCV treatment initiation was defined as documentation 1) by the provider that treatment commenced, or 2) that the prescription was picked up from the pharmacy. The SVR12 visit was defined as documentation that a visit occurred to obtain an HCV RNA result within the study period and ≥12 weeks after the end of treatment. Achieving laboratory-confirmed SVR12 was defined as receipt of an undetectable HCV RNA test result at ≥12 weeks after completion of treatment. Although not included in the cascade of care, treatment completion, defined as documentation by the provider that treatment was completed, or that all prescription refills were picked up from the pharmacy, was assessed. Persons who completed treatment and were assessed for an HCV RNA test result after treatment completion but before the SVR12 due date were not included in the last two stages of the cascade of care (i.e., an SVR12 visit and laboratory-confirmed SVR12).
Sex, age, and presence of advanced liver disease (ascertained using noninvasive liver staging methods, as identified by serologic biomarkers [fibrosis-4 index >3.25†]) were also assessed. Treatments during this period consisted of interferon-free, all oral, direct-acting antivirals).
Progress along each step of the cascade of care was assessed by calculating 1) the proportion of persons who completed each step among the population of persons with diagnosed HCV infection, and 2) the proportion of persons at each step who moved to the next step. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 19; IBM Corp.) was used to conduct all analyses. Because this activity was considered a surveillance and public services delivery program, and the data were collected in the context of clinical care,§ it was deemed exempt from review by the Cherokee Nation Institutional Review Board. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶
Among 1,423 persons who received a diagnosis of HCV infection during November 1, 2015–October 31, 2020, and who had available demographic data, 870 (61.1%) were male, and 545 (38.3%) were female; 351 (24.7%) were aged 31–40 and 370 (26.0%) were aged 51–60 years. A total of 189 (13.3%) persons met criteria for advanced liver disease or cirrhosis (Table).
Among the 1,423 persons with a diagnosis of HCV infection, 1,227 (86.2%) were linked to HCV care, and 871 (71.0%) of those initiated HCV treatment. Among persons who initiated treatment, 702 (80.6%) returned for their SVR12 visit, among whom 698 (99.4%) achieved laboratory-confirmed SVR12 (Figure).
Among the 871 persons who initiated treatment, 800 (91.8%) completed treatment. In addition to the 871 persons who initiated treatment during the study period, another 17 persons initiated and completed HCV treatment after the study period concluded on October 31, 2020; to align with consensus definitions (7), these 17 persons were included in the diagnosis and linkage to care levels but excluded from subsequent cascade levels. Among 98 persons who completed treatment but did not return for their SVR12 visit, 40 (40.8%) had evidence of SVR before a 12-week posttreatment visit was due. These results were also not included in the cascade of care.** Eleven of the 98 persons who did not return for an SVR12 visit during the study period had undetectable HCV RNA test results outside of the study period. To align with consensus definitions (7), these 11 persons were included in all cascade levels, except the SVR12 visit (Table).

Discussion
These findings align with those published in a 2022 global systematic review of HCV elimination activities (8). Five years after implementing the CNHS HCV Elimination Program, approximately 86% of persons who received a diagnosis of HCV infection were linked to care; however, only 61% initiated treatment, 56% completed treatment, and just under 50% achieved SVR12. Among those who initiated treatment and returned for SVR12 visits, 99.4% were cured. Given the high rate of treatment success with direct-acting antivirals, it is likely that the majority of persons who initiated treatment were also cured (9). Thus, although linkage to care has been successful, treatment initiation continues to be a barrier to achieving HCV elimination within the Cherokee Nation.
There are several potential explanations for the gap from HCV treatment evaluation to treatment initiation within the CNHS program. First, Oklahoma Medicaid did not cover hepatitis C treatment for persons with fibrosis scores of F0 or F1 (little to no scarring) until 2018 (10). In addition, for all payor types, a previous authorization was required, and although HCV evaluation occurred, several weeks to months might have lapsed before HCV treatment medication became available (10). Further, some payors required evaluation by a specialist or that the prescription be written in consultation with a specialist, further delaying treatment initiation (10). These delays might have led to some persons falling out of care.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because this evaluation was conducted among persons served by one Tribal health system, findings might not be generalizable to persons served by other health systems. Second, this evaluation relied on consensus cascade definitions (7) that differed from CNHS’s previously published cascades of care and, as a result, these findings are not directly comparable. Third, persons included in this study might have received care outside of CNHS, leading to underreporting of true cascade outcomes. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic overlapped with the final seven months of this evaluation. Although it is impossible to fully ascertain the effects of COVID-19 on the results of this evaluation, the pandemic might have reduced the numbers of persons attending care visits, initiating treatment, and obtaining laboratory tests to monitor viral load, including SVR12. Despite these limitations, these findings are important because of the disproportionate impact of HCV infection and lack of HCV research among AI/AN persons.
To achieve HCV elimination, the reasons for the gaps at each stage of the cascade of care need to be addressed, especially the delay in the acquisition of hepatitis C medications. For CNHS, emphasis on treatment initiation should be a priority. Future research should explore barriers to linkage to care, initiating treatment after HCV evaluation, completing treatment, and returning for the SVR12 visit among AI/AN persons, as well as interventions to address these barriers.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
SARS-CoV-2 hybrid immunity (immunity derived from both previous infection and vaccination) has been reported to provide better protection than that from infection or vaccination alone.
What is added by this report?
By the third quarter of 2022, an estimated 96.4% of persons aged ≥16 years in a longitudinal blood donor cohort had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from previous infection or vaccination, including 22.6% from infection alone and 26.1% from vaccination alone; 47.7% had hybrid immunity. Hybrid immunity prevalence was lowest among adults aged ≥65 years.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Low prevalence of infection-induced and hybrid immunity among older adults, who are at increased risk for severe disease if infected, reflects the success of public health infection prevention efforts while also highlighting the importance of this group staying up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, including at least 1 bivalent dose.

Changes in testing behaviors and reporting requirements have hampered the ability to estimate the U.S. SARS-CoV-2 incidence (1). Hybrid immunity (immunity derived from both previous infection and vaccination) has been reported to provide better protection than that from infection or vaccination alone (2). To estimate the incidence of infection and the prevalence of infection- or vaccination-induced antibodies (or both), data from a nationwide, longitudinal cohort of blood donors were analyzed. During the second quarter of 2021 (April–June), an estimated 68.4% of persons aged ≥16 years had infection- or vaccination-induced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including 47.5% from vaccination alone, 12.0% from infection alone, and 8.9% from both. By the third quarter of 2022 (July–September), 96.4% had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from previous infection or vaccination, including 22.6% from infection alone and 26.1% from vaccination alone; 47.7% had hybrid immunity. Prevalence of hybrid immunity was lowest among persons aged ≥65 years (36.9%), the group with the highest risk for severe disease if infected, and was highest among those aged 16–29 years (59.6%). Low prevalence of infection-induced and hybrid immunity among older adults reflects the success of public health infection prevention efforts while also highlighting the importance of older adults staying up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, including at least 1 bivalent dose.*,†
Since July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the United States has been estimated by testing blood donations (3). CDC, in collaboration with Vitalant, American Red Cross, Creative Testing Solutions, and Westat, established a nationwide cohort of 142,758 blood donors in July 2021; the cohort included persons who had donated blood two or more times in the preceding year.§ All blood donations collected during April–June 2021 were tested for antibodies against the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Beginning in 2022, up to one blood donation sample per donor was randomly selected each quarter and tested using the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 Quantitative S immunoglobulin G¶ and total N antibody** tests. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination result in production of anti-S antibodies, whereas anti-N antibodies only result from infection. At each donation, blood donors were asked if they had received a COVID-19 vaccine. Using vaccination history and results of antibody testing, the prevalence of the U.S. population aged ≥16 years with vaccine-induced, infection-induced, or hybrid immunity was estimated for four 3-month periods (April–June 2021, January–March 2022, April–June 2022, and July–September 2022); in addition, the proportion of persons who transitioned from one immune status to another by quarter was estimated. Analysis was limited to 72,748 (51.0%) donors for whom it was possible to ascertain immune status during each period using their prior classification (e.g., previously infected or vaccinated), antibody testing results, and their vaccination status at the time of each donation.†† The sample data were weighted to account for selection into the study cohort, for nonresponse during the four analysis periods, and for demographic differences between the blood donor population and the overall U.S. population. The weights were obtained through a combination of stratification and raking, an iterative weighting adjustment procedure (4). Rates of infection among those previously uninfected were estimated for each period by determining the percentage of anti-N–negative persons seroconverting to anti-N–positive from one 3-month period included in the study to the next. Estimates were stratified by age group (16–29, 30–49, 50–64, and ≥65 years) and race and ethnicity§§ (Asian, Black or African American [Black], White, Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], and other). SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used to compute the final weights, and R (version 4.2.1; R Foundation) was used to calculate all the estimates and create the plots.¶¶ Seroprevalence and infection rates were estimated as weighted means and compared by demographic group and vaccination status using two-sided t-tests with a significance level of α = 0.05. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***
During the first quarter examined (April–June 2021), an estimated 68.4% (95% CI = 67.8%–68.9%) of persons aged ≥16 years had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from previous infection or vaccination, including 47.5% (95% CI = 46.0%–49.0%) from vaccination alone, 12.0% (95% CI = 10.8%–13.5%) from infection alone, and 8.9% (95% CI = 8.7%–9.2%) from both (Figure 1) (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128630). During January–March 2022, 93.5% (95% CI = 93.1%–93.9%) of persons aged ≥16 years had antibodies from previous infection or vaccination, including 39.0% (95% CI = 37.4%–40.7%) from vaccination alone, 20.5% (95% CI = 19.2%–22.2%) from infection alone, and 34.1% (95% CI = 32.4%–35.8%) from both. During July–September 2022, 96.4% (95% CI = 96.1%–96.7%) of persons had antibodies from previous infection or vaccination, including 26.1% (95% CI = 25.4%–26.9%) with vaccine-induced immunity alone, 22.6% (95% CI = 21.2%–24.1%) with infection-induced immunity alone, and 47.7% (95% CI = 44.8%–51.2%) with hybrid immunity. During July–September 2022, the prevalence of infection-induced immunity was 85.7% (95% CI = 79.8%–90.2%) among unvaccinated persons and 64.3% (95% CI = 61.9%–66.7%) among vaccinated persons.
During July–September 2022, the lowest prevalence of hybrid immunity, 36.9% (95% CI = 35.8%–38.1%), was observed in persons aged ≥65 years, and the highest, 59.6% (95% CI = 56.7%–62.3%), in adolescents and young adults aged 16–29 years (Figure 2) (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128679). During all periods, higher prevalences of hybrid immunity were observed among Black and Hispanic populations than among White and Asian populations (Supplementary Figure 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128680).
Among persons with no previous infection, the incidence of first infections during the study period (i.e., conversion from anti-N–negative to anti-N–positive) was higher among unvaccinated persons (Table). From April–June 2021 through January–March 2022, the incidence of first SARS-CoV-2 infections among unvaccinated persons was 67.0%, compared with 26.3% among vaccinated persons (p<0.05). From January–March 2022 through April–June 2022, the incidence among unvaccinated persons was 21.7% and was 13.3% among vaccinated persons. Between April–June 2022 and July–September 2022, the incidence among unvaccinated persons was 28.3%, compared with 22.9% among vaccinated persons (p<0.05). Incidence of first SARS-CoV-2 infections was higher among younger than among older persons and was lower among Asian persons than among other racial and ethnic populations, but the differences among groups narrowed over time.

Discussion
Both infection-induced and hybrid immunity increased during the study period. By the third quarter of 2022, approximately two thirds of persons aged ≥16 years had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and one half of all persons had hybrid immunity. Compared with vaccine effectiveness against any infection and against severe disease or hospitalization, the effectiveness of hybrid immunity against these outcomes has been shown to be higher and wane more slowly (2). This increase in seroprevalence, including hybrid immunity, is likely contributing to lower rates of severe disease and death from COVID-19 in 2022–2023 than during the early pandemic.††† The prevalence of hybrid immunity is lowest in adults aged ≥65 years, likely due to higher vaccination coverage and earlier availability of COVID-19 vaccines for this age group, as well as to higher prevalences of behavioral practices to avoid infection (5). However, lower prevalences of infection-induced and hybrid immunity could further increase the risk for severe disease in this group, highlighting the importance for adults aged ≥65 years to stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination and have easy access to antiviral medications.
COVID-19 vaccine efficacy studies have reported reduced effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron-predominant period compared with earlier periods and have shown that protection against infection wanes more rapidly than does protection against severe disease (6,7). In this study, unvaccinated persons had higher rates of infection (as evidenced by N antibody seroconversion) than did vaccinated persons, indicating that vaccination provides some protection against infection. The differences in incidence could also be due to systematic differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons in terms of the prevalence of practicing prevention behaviors such as masking and physical distancing. The relative difference in infection rates narrowed during the most recent months, possibly because of waning of vaccine-induced protection against infection in the setting of increased time after vaccination or immune evasion by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. The narrowing of difference in infection rates might also be attributable to increasing similarities in behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons during late 2022 (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, although COVID-19 booster vaccine doses and reinfections can strengthen immunity (9,10), this analysis did not account for these effects because blood donor vaccination history did not include the number of doses received, and data on reinfections were not captured. Second, immunity wanes over time, but time since vaccination or infection was not included in the analysis (2). Third, vaccination status was self-reported, potentially leading to misclassification. Fourth, although the results were adjusted based on differences in blood donor and general population demographics, estimates from blood donors might not be representative of the general population; thus, these results might not be generalizable. Fifth, vaccinated and unvaccinated persons might differ in other ways not captured by this analysis (8), nor can causality be inferred from the results on relative infection incidence. Finally, if both vaccination and infection occurred between blood donations included in the study, the order of occurrence could not be determined, and some unvaccinated donors might have been vaccinated before infection and thus misclassified; in 2022, this was uncommon and occurred in <0.5% of donors during any 3-month period.
This report found that the incidence of first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower among persons who had received COVID-19 vaccine than among unvaccinated persons and that infection-induced and hybrid immunity have increased but remain lowest in adults aged ≥65 years. These adults have consistently had a higher risk for severe disease compared with younger age groups, underscoring the importance of older adults staying up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, including at least 1 bivalent dose.

If both vaccination and infection occurred between donations included in the study, the order could not be determined, and some unvaccinated donors might have been vaccinated before infection and thus misclassified.
† If donors who transitioned from no antibodies to hybrid immunity between April–June 2021 and January–March 2022 were excluded, an estimated 55.5% (95% CI = 53.9%–57.1%) of unvaccinated donors were infected. For other periods, exclusion did not substantially change results. Between January–March and April–June 2022, 0.4% of persons shifted from no antibodies to hybrid immunity. Between April–June and July–September 2022, 0.3% of persons shifted from no antibodies to hybrid immunity.

In October 2022, the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) was notified of a higher-than-expected number of pediatric patients hospitalized with intracranial abscesses; similar concerns were previously reported nationally (1,2). This rare infection is associated with significant morbidity (3,4). When SNHD received the report in October 2022, 14 cases had been diagnosed in the largest pediatric hospital in southern Nevada. SNHD investigated the reported increase to confirm that a cluster had been detected, identify common risk factors for infection, report findings to the community, and recommend measures to prevent future cases.
The observed and expected number of cases were compared to confirm and describe the cluster. Historical median quarterly case numbers with IQRs were obtained from discharge data from all hospitals in Clark County, Nevada during January 2015–December 2021. Persons with primary, secondary, or tertiary discharge diagnoses of intracranial abscess and granuloma (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] code G06.0) or extradural and subdural abscess, unspecified (ICD-10-CM code G06.2) during January 2015–December 2022 among persons aged ≤18 years were identified as cases. Because hospital discharge data from the final quarter of 2022 were not available at the time of investigation, cases in 2022 were primarily identified through provider reporting and confirmed by discharge data, if available; for these data, a case was defined as diagnosis of an intraparenchymal abscess, subdural abscess or empyema, epidural abscess or empyema, or evidence of other intracranial extension observed on brain imaging in a person aged ≤18 years without a previous neurosurgical procedure or history of significant head trauma. Detailed medical chart abstraction and semistructured telephone interviews with families affected during 2022 were conducted to ascertain clinical course, risk factors, and exposures. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*
During 2015–2021 overall, a median of one case per quarter (IQR = 0–2.0) was identified in Clark County. However, during the period preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (2015–2019), the quarterly median was 0.5 cases (IQR = 0–2.0), and during the first 2 years of the pandemic (2020–2021), the median number of quarterly cases reported was 1.5 (IQR = 0–2.5). During 2022, 18 cases were identified (median = five per quarter; IQR = 3.5– 6.0); all occurred after February 2022 (Figure).
Review of medical charts of the 18 cases reported in 2022 found that the median patient age was 12 years (range = 4–15 years) and that all but four cases occurred in males. Children and adolescents were hospitalized for a median of 15 days (range = 9–76 days), and 15 patients required craniotomy for abscess drainage. Sinusitis was diagnosed in 14 patients and mastoiditis in four. No patients received a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. No associated deaths were reported.
Telephone interviews were conducted with 14 caregivers as a proxy for the affected child or adolescent, nine of whom reported that the child had cold symptoms, including rhinorrhea, before hospitalization; seven experienced other symptoms, including headache (three), headache with fever (three), and mild head injuries (two).† Eleven caregivers sought care for their child before hospitalization, most often at an emergency department (seven). The median interval from symptom onset to hospitalization was 7 days (range = 2–14 days). Nine interviewees reported that the child had been swimming during the 4 weeks preceding hospitalization, but not at the same pool locations. Five interviewees reported cessation of masking practices after the COVID-19 mask mandate was lifted,§ including three who reported cold symptoms experienced by the affected child before hospitalization.
A 2022 investigation of possible increased incidence of pediatric intracranial abscesses identified a higher number of cases in 2022 compared with that reported in 2021 (2). Contributing to this increase was a period of elevated cases beginning in mid-2021, which followed a period of consistently low case counts after the onset of the pandemic (2). This pattern was also observed in the current investigation. Although this investigation did not identify unexpected risk factors for intracranial abscesses, the substantial increase in cases after the mask mandate in Nevada was lifted might be partially attributable to changes in respiratory pathogen transmission. SNHD released a health advisory notice to pediatric health care providers detailing the investigation findings; surveillance will be continued through 2023 to better monitor trends in incidence of pediatric intracranial infections.

In May 2022, CDC began an investigation of a possible increase in pediatric intracranial infections, particularly those caused by Streptococcus bacteria, during the preceding year (1). January 2016–May 2022 data from a large, geographically diverse network of children’s hospitals showed altered patterns in pediatric intracranial infections after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (1). In this update, extended hospitalization data through March 2023 from 37 hospitals in 19 states and the District of Columbia showed a higher-than-expected number of pediatric intracranial infections beginning in August 2021, with a large peak during winter 2022–2023. Pediatric intracranial infections are recognized as a severe complication of viral respiratory infection and sinusitis (2), and the winter 2022–2023 peak coincided with spikes in respiratory virus circulation*,† (3,4). Even during this peak, intracranial infections remained rare. CDC continues to track trends in pediatric intracranial infections and recommends that all persons aged ≤18 years remain current with recommended vaccinations, including influenza and COVID-19.§
To characterize national trends in pediatric intracranial infections, CDC analyzed pediatric hospitalizations for brain abscesses, epidural empyemas, and subdural empyemas reported to the Children’s Hospital Association’s Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) by 37 tertiary referral children’s hospitals in 19 states and the District of Columbia. The included hospitals consistently reported to PHIS during January 1, 2016–March 31, 2023 (the most recent data available when the analysis was performed).¶ All inpatient encounters with persons aged ≤18 years that had a primary or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification discharge diagnosis code G06.0 (intracranial abscess and granuloma) or G06.2 (extradural and subdural abscess, unspecified) during the study period were included. Because the study period was extended from that of the earlier report (1), the subset of included hospitals differed slightly from that previously analyzed and reported. Data were analyzed in aggregate and by U.S. Census Bureau region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) using R software (version 4.0.3; R Foundation) with RStudio (version 1.3.1093; Posit, PBC). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**
Using pediatric intracranial infection hospitalization data collected during 2016–2019, the monthly median (34; IQR = 29.75–42.00) and maximum (61) number of cases were calculated as a prepandemic baseline (Figure). After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, monthly intracranial infection case counts remained below the baseline median during May 2020–May 2021. Monthly case counts exceeded the median during August 2021–March 2023†† but did not exceed the baseline maximum until a large peak (102 cases) in December 2022. During January–March 2023, case counts began to decline but remained above the baseline maximum. Although some variability between U.S. Census Bureau regions was observed, overall patterns were generally similar: consistently low case counts after the onset of the pandemic, then a period of increase beginning in mid- to late 2021 followed by a large peak during winter 2022–2023 (Figure). Demographic characteristics of patients (age, race and ethnicity, and sex), measures of severity (length of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and in-hospital mortality), and the percentage of patients with a complex chronic condition (5) remained approximately stable over the study period and were similar to values reported previously (1).
This analysis in a large, geographically diverse network of children’s hospitals showed elevations in pediatric intracranial infections beginning in mid-2021 with a large spike in winter 2022–2023, both nationally and by U.S. Census Bureau region. Despite these observed increases, pediatric intracranial infections remain rare. These infections are often preceded by viral respiratory infection and sinusitis, and recent trends might be driven by concurrent, heightened pediatric respiratory pathogen transmission (3,4). All persons aged ≤18 years should be up to date with recommended vaccinations, including influenza and COVID-19. CDC will continue to track trends in pediatric intracranial infections.

","Potential for Recurrent Mpox Outbreaks Among Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men â United States, 2023
Weekly / May 26, 2023 / 72(21);568â573

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Monkeypox (mpox) has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM); the percentage of MSM with immunity due to vaccination or infection varies among jurisdictions.
What is added by this report?
Mathematical modeling suggests that the risk for future outbreaks depends linearly on the level of immunity in the population at risk; cumulative incidence, on the other hand, has multiple thresholds. More than 592,000 MSM live in jurisdictions with risk for mpox recurrences capable of sustained transmission if a cluster of infectious cases were reintroduced.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increasing vaccination coverage among MSM at risk and in jurisdictions with low immunity has the potential to reduce the risk for and potential size of future mpox outbreaks.

More than 30,000 monkeypox (mpox) cases have been diagnosed in the United States since May 2022, primarily among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (1,2). In recent months, diagnoses have declined to one case per day on average. However, mpox vaccination coverage varies regionally, suggesting variable potential risk for mpox outbreak recurrence (3). CDC simulated dynamic network models representing sexual behavior among MSM to estimate the risk for and potential size of recurrent mpox outbreaks at the jurisdiction level for 2023 and to evaluate the benefits of vaccination for preparedness against mpox reintroduction. The risk for outbreak recurrence after mpox reintroduction is linearly (inversely) related to the proportion of MSM who have some form of protective immunity: the higher the population prevalence of immunity (from vaccination or natural infection), the lower the likelihood of recurrence in that jurisdiction across all immunity levels modeled. In contrast, the size of a potential recurrent outbreak might have thresholds: very small recurrences are predicted for jurisdictions with mpox immunity of 50%–100%; exponentially increasing sizes of recurrences are predicted for jurisdictions with 25%–50% immunity; and linearly increasing sizes of recurrences are predicted for jurisdictions with <25% immunity. Among the 50 jurisdictions examined, 15 are predicted to be at minimal risk for recurrence because of their high levels of population immunity. This analysis underscores the ongoing need for accessible and sustained mpox vaccination to decrease the risk for and potential size of future mpox recurrences.
CDC adapted models of mpox transmission to estimate the risk for and size of potential mpox recurrences at varying levels of population-level mpox immunity (4,5). Immunity varied from 0%–99% in increments of approximately 4%. Immunity levels included persons who had received 1 or 2 vaccine doses or had a history of infection, which conveyed 37%, 67%, and 100% reduction in susceptibility to infection, respectively (6). At each immunity level modeled, 29%, 67%, and 4% of those with some immunity were assumed to have 1-dose, 2-dose, or infection-acquired immunity, respectively, with immunity concentrated among MSM with higher levels of sexual activity (3,4). Sensitivity analyses considered 65% and 83% reductions in susceptibility associated with receipt of 1 or 2 doses, respectively (6).
To model mpox reintroduction, five MSM with infectious mpox and high levels of sexual activity were introduced to the sexual network. Depending on the level of immunity and chance, introduced cases either initiated an outbreak (of variable size) or failed to sustain transmission. An outbreak was defined as a simulation with sustained mpox incidence 3 months after reintroduction. For each immunity level, model simulations were conducted until 50 simulated recurrent outbreaks occurred. This analysis assumed no additional vaccination after April 28, 2023, no behavioral adaptation (such as decreasing partner acquisition rates) among MSM in response to new mpox cases, and no loss of immunity due to demographic turnover during the 2-year period modeled.
Risk was assessed at the jurisdiction level for the 50 nonstate, Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative jurisdictions based on these results and each jurisdiction’s case and vaccine administration data, through April 2023 (4,5). These jurisdictions, many of which contain urban centers with large MSM populations, account for more than one half of all new HIV diagnoses.* The numerator for jurisdiction immunity level was the sum of persons who had received 1 and 2 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine and those who had already been infected, accounting for potential incomplete reporting (2,3,5). The denominator was based on the population at increased risk for Monkeypox virus exposure, estimated as the number of MSM aged ≥16 years who were recommended to receive HIV preexposure prophylaxis and the number of MSM aged ≥13 years living with HIV in each jurisdiction, using publicly available data (7,8). The estimated population was then increased by 25% for each jurisdiction to account for additional persons eligible for vaccination (e.g., MSM with lower levels of sexual activity than their already-eligible partners). Statistical models were fit to the simulated outbreak results to summarize the relationship between immunity level and both risk for and size of outbreak recurrence; each jurisdiction’s risk for and size of outbreak recurrence was then then inferred based on jurisdiction-specific immunity using these fitted curves. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
Conditional on mpox reintroduction into a jurisdiction, the risk for a recurrent mpox outbreak is linearly related to immunity: each percentage point increase in population immunity reduces outbreak risk by 0.62 percentage points across all immunity levels modeled (Figure 1). For example, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, with an estimated at-risk population immunity of 64%, has a 21% risk for a recurrent outbreak, whereas Harris County, Texas, with 17% immunity has a 50% risk, conditional on reintroduction (Table). No critical threshold to avert a recurrent mpox outbreak was identified; higher vaccination coverage among MSM at risk provides continued decreased recurrence risk across all immunity levels modeled. Sensitivity analyses using higher efficacy estimates of 65% and 83%, respectively, decreased the recurrence risk by 6 percentage points when population immunity was >20% (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128422).
In contrast to the linear relationship between increasing levels of immunity in the population at risk and the risk for a recurrent outbreak, immunity does have a threshold effect on the size of a recurrent outbreak (Figure 2). Three distinct jurisdictional groupings were identified: those with high, medium, and low immunity, defined as 50%–100%, 25%–49%, and <25% vaccine- or infection-induced immunity, respectively. High-immunity jurisdictions were predicted to experience small recurrences that resolved within 1 year. Medium-immunity jurisdictions were transitional, with more uncertainty: recurrence size increased exponentially and lasted 12–17 months. Finally, low-immunity jurisdictions were predicted to experience recurrences lasting 18–20 months that increased linearly in size with decreasing levels of immunity.
Overall, 44% of MSM at increased risk for Monkeypox virus exposure who live in EHE jurisdictions live in high-immunity jurisdictions that are likely to have minimal risk for recurrence, including Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, DC (Table). However, 56% of MSM at increased risk for exposure who live in EHE jurisdictions live in low- or medium-immunity jurisdictions that are potentially at risk for mpox recurrences capable of sustained transmission should reintroduction occur (Table).

Discussion
This analysis, which highlights the association between population mpox immunity and the risk for outbreak recurrence, underscores the need for accessible and sustained mpox vaccination services, particularly in communities with low vaccination coverage and among MSM at highest risk. Jurisdictions that achieved high vaccination coverage among populations at risk are not expected to experience large recurrences in the immediate future. Success in achieving high coverage in these jurisdictions was partially driven by early prioritization for vaccine distribution because of high early case counts when there was high vaccination demand. In other jurisdictions, vaccines became available after the outbreak had peaked and when demand had declined because of reduced perception of risk (5).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, to consider the downstream effects of mpox reintroduction and guide preparedness, mpox reintroduction was assumed to be certain. However, actual reintroduction risk will be influenced by global and local mpox infection dynamics. Although the intensity of the 2022 multinational outbreak has diminished substantially, areas with ongoing transmission remain. Attendance at large social engagements that attract domestic and international MSM travelers could result in reintroduction of mpox into local sexual networks. Assuming reintroduction is independent of subsequent outbreak recurrence risk, reintroduction has a proportional effect on recurrence: for example, if there were a 50% probability of reintroduction, the risk for recurrence would be 50% lower than that presented in the current analysis. In the absence of additional vaccination or mpox cases, immunity will decline in future years because of demographic turnover, thereby increasing recurrence risk. In addition, small outbreaks might occur even when the estimated risk for a large outbreak is relatively low. As an example, based on this model, Cook County, Illinois, has an estimated 22% risk for a sustained mpox recurrence; however, the city of Chicago, which is part of Cook County, has reported a new cluster of mpox cases that emerged in April 2023 (9). Second, inferred estimates of vaccine efficacy from Israel and the United States show a range of effectiveness (6). Conservative estimates for 1- and 2-dose efficacy of 37% and 67%, respectively, were used in the primary analysis, although sensitivity analysis examining higher efficacy did not appreciably change the results. Third, many of the sexual behavior data were derived from surveys conducted in 2012, and it is possible that patterns have changed over time and in response to recent disruptive public health events, including this mpox outbreak (10). The actual risk for and size of recurrent outbreaks might differ among the actual social and sexual engagements of MSM, which might also vary between communities. Finally, this analysis assumed no interventions took place in response to mpox reintroduction. However, this assumption highlights the benefits of vaccination for preparedness against mpox reintroduction. Delays between detection of reintroduction, mobilization of additional vaccination sites, vaccine administration, and immunologic protection are difficult to shorten, potentially leaving vulnerable communities at risk.
This analysis highlights the importance of public health programs identifying opportunities to promote vaccination before Pride-related and other events when vaccination interest might be higher, rather than vaccinating after reintroduction is identified. Focusing these vaccination efforts in low-coverage areas, and even in high-coverage areas, among MSM who are younger and newly sexually active and among groups with disproportionally low vaccination coverage, can help protect both individual persons and the entire community against a resurgence of mpox. CDC continues to recommend a full 2-dose course of the JYNNEOS vaccine for MSM and others at risk for Monkeypox virus exposure.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Monkeypox (mpox) has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Information on urbanicity of mpox cases during the 2022 outbreak is limited.
What is added by this report?
During May–December 2022, U.S. mpox incidence was 13.5 per 100,000 persons peaking in August. Among cisgender men and cisgender women, incidence in rural areas was 4% and 11% of incidence in large central urban areas, respectively. Incidence among Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino persons was higher than among White persons.
What are the implications for public health practice?
National mpox surveillance should be continued to ensure persons at risk for mpox get tested and treated. Prevention efforts should be focused on MSM in urban areas.

During May 10–December 31, 2022, a total of 29,980 confirmed and probable† U.S. monkeypox (mpox) cases were reported to CDC, predominantly in cisgender adult men reporting recent same-gender sexual partners (1). Urban-rural differences in health (2) and diagnosis of HIV (3,4) and other sexually transmitted infections (5) are well documented nationally. This report describes urban-rural differences in mpox incidence (cases per 100,000 population) among persons aged 15–64 years, by gender and race and ethnicity. Urbanicity was assessed using the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties (2). Substantial differences in incidence by urbanicity, gender, and race and ethnicity were observed; most (71.0%) cases occurred in persons residing in large central urban areas. Among the cases in large central urban areas, most (95.7%) were in cisgender men. The overall incidence of mpox in the United States was 13.5 per 100,000 persons aged 15–64 years and peaked in August in both urban and rural areas. Among cisgender men, incidence in rural areas was approximately 4% that in large central urban areas (risk ratio [RR] = 0.04). Among cisgender women, incidence in rural areas was approximately 11% that in large central urban areas (RR = 0.11). In both urban and rural areas, incidence among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons was consistently higher than that among non-Hispanic White (White) persons; RRs between Black and White persons were highest in rural areas. Support and maintenance of mpox surveillance and prevention efforts including vaccinations should focus on urban areas with the highest incidence of mpox during the 2022 outbreak; however, surveillance and prevention efforts should include all genders, persons of color, and persons residing in both urban and rural areas who are at increased risk for mpox.
Jurisdictional health departments electronically reported data on confirmed and probable mpox cases as part of the national case surveillance through a standardized case report form or via the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.§ Urbanicity of county of residence was defined using the NCHS six-level classification scheme: four levels for metropolitan (urban) counties (large central, large fringe, medium, and small) and two levels for nonmetropolitan (rural) counties (micropolitan and noncore)¶ (2). Two U.S. counties were not represented in the analyses because they were not assigned an NCHS urban-rural classification; however, neither of these counties reported cases in 2022. Because of small case numbers, micropolitan and noncore groups were combined into one rural group. Incidence by each of the five levels of urbanicity was calculated by 1) summing cases from counties of the same level of urbanicity (numerator) and 2) summing county-level 2021 CDC WONDER population for persons aged 15–64 years** from counties with the same level of urbanicity (denominator). This analysis was limited to incidence estimates among persons aged 15–64 years because the majority of mpox cases were in this age range and to reduce bias that might be introduced by differential age distribution by urbanicity. Incidence estimates were stratified by month, gender, or race and ethnicity. RRs with 95% CIs were calculated between groups (e.g., urban compared with rural areas). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††
The 29,980 confirmed and probable mpox cases reported to CDC in 2022 included 29,311 (97.8%) cases among persons aged 15–64 years in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Most cases among persons aged 15–64 years occurred in large central urban areas (71.0%); however, cases were reported at each level of urbanicity, including 440 (1.5%) in rural areas (Table 1). The median age (34 years) and distribution of mpox patients by age group were similar for all urban-rural categories. In large central urban areas, 95.7% and 2.3% of cases were in cisgender men and cisgender women, respectively, and in rural areas, 94.7% and 4.6% of cases were in these groups, respectively.
Racial and ethnic distributions of cases differed by urbanicity. Hispanic persons accounted for 33.8% and 26.5% of cases in large central urban and large fringe urban areas, respectively, but only 14.3% and 15.1% in small urban and rural areas, respectively. The proportion of cases in small urban and rural areas among White persons (42.8% and 43.3% respectively), was higher than that in other urban areas (28.2% in large central, 28.2% in large fringe, and 35.8% in medium). The proportion of cases among Black persons differed across each category of urbanicity, ranging from 30.8% in large central urban areas to 40.1% in large fringe urban areas. The number of mpox cases in other racial and ethnic groups was small, and the relationship with urbanicity could not be assessed.
Overall mpox incidence was 13.5 per 100,000 (Table 2) but varied by urbanicity. Rates in large fringe urban areas (9.7), medium urban areas (4.9), small urban areas (2.8), and rural areas (1.5) were 32%, 16%, 9%, and 5% the rate in large central urban areas (30.6), respectively (Table 2) (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128431). In all areas, incidence peaked in August and then declined during October–December.
Overall, incidence was 27.2 in cisgender men and 0.7 in cisgender women (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128432). Among both groups, rates were highest in large central urban areas and were lower in small urban areas (Figure), (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128431) (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128432). Among cisgender men, incidence in rural areas (2.8 per 100,000) was approximately 4% that in large central urban areas (65.0; RR = 0.04). Among cisgender women, rates in rural areas (0.1) were approximately 11% that in large central urban areas (1.3; RR = 0.11).
In urban and rural areas, incidence was higher among cisgender men than among cisgender women, with the highest RR (51.2) in large central urban areas where the incidence in cisgender men was highest (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128431). In rural areas, the relative difference in incidence between cisgender men and cisgender women was lower (RR = 19.8).
In both urban and rural areas, incidence was higher among Black persons compared with White persons (Figure) (Supplementary Table 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128433). The relative difference in incidence between Black and White persons was highest in rural areas (RR = 7.2) (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128431); however, the absolute difference was highest in large central urban areas where incidence per 100,000 persons aged 15–64 years in Black persons was 52.3 and in White persons was 19.7 (Supplementary Table 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128433). In addition, in urban and rural areas, rates were higher among Hispanic persons than among White persons (Figure). Lastly, in urban and rural areas, incidence was higher among Black persons than among Hispanic persons.

Discussion
In the United States, 85% of the population lives in areas classified as urban (2), and the majority of mpox cases occurred in urban areas (1), with the highest incidence in large central urban areas. Across all urban-rural levels, incidence peaked in August 2022. Although the number of mpox cases decreased sharply after this date, the risk for outbreak and recurrence is dependent on the estimated immunity level, which is calculated by the number of cases during the 2022 outbreak and vaccination rates (6).
During the 2022 mpox outbreak, approximately 95% of mpox cases were among cisgender men. Among both cisgender men and cisgender women, incidence was lower with decreasing urbanicity. Incidence was consistently higher among cisgender men than among cisgender women in all urban-rural areas; however, the relative difference in incidence was less in rural areas.
In large central urban areas, proportions of cases among Black, Hispanic, and White persons were similar; however, the incidence was much higher among Black and Hispanic persons than among White persons. In rural areas, most cases were among both Black (35%) and White (43%) persons; however, rates among Black (6.2) and Hispanic (2.4) persons were approximately six and two times higher, respectively, than incidence among White persons (0.9).
During the multinational outbreak in 2022, 1- and 2- dose mpox vaccination coverage, among persons at risk in the United States, reached an estimated 37% and 23%, respectively, with wide variation across the country (7). Preventive efforts, including vaccination campaigns, were concentrated in urban areas because of the large number of cases in these areas during the mpox response (7). The estimated higher incidence in urban areas underscores the need for services, especially in large central urban areas; however, mpox prevention, recognition, diagnosis, and treatment services are still needed in less urban and rural areas. In addition, in light of the lower incidence observed in less urban areas and potentially lower levels of immunity acquired through natural infection, larger proportions of the population in smaller urban and rural areas might be susceptible to infection.
Previously published information indicated that barriers to accessing prevention services in rural areas might result from fewer service locations, shortages in providers, cultural barriers, stigma, and fewer provider referrals for testing and vaccination (5,8). Further, these barriers exist in the context of persistent racial and ethnic health disparities, particularly among men, in rural areas (9). In rural areas, the higher incidence observed among Black and Hispanic persons compared with White persons might be attributed to known barriers to accessing care combined with existing health inequalities. Further research into mpox risk factors, incidence, transmission potential, vaccination coverage, and access to prevention and care services by urbanicity, gender, and race and ethnicity is needed for public health decision-making and improving equitable prevention and care among those at risk.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, sample sizes did not permit reliable estimation of incidence by urbanicity among transgender or gender diverse persons, or among some racial and ethnic groups. Second, methods for collecting gender information are not standardized across the United States. When self-reported gender data were missing, current sex or sex assigned at birth was used, and gender identity was presumed to be cisgender. This limitation could have resulted in undercounting transgender or gender-diverse persons, particularly in jurisdictions that do not routinely collect this information. Finally, persons with mpox might have been less likely to receive an mpox diagnosis in rural areas, potentially because of inadequate access or limited testing availability. If mpox was less likely to be detected and consequently diagnosed in less urban and rural areas, than in large central urban areas, incidence might have been underestimated in rural and less urban areas.
The 2022 U.S. mpox outbreak was largely driven by transmission among cisgender men reporting recent same-gender sexual partners in large central urban areas (1). However, although incidence was lower in less urban areas, this analysis found that cases also occurred among cisgender men in less urban areas, and among cisgender women in both urban and rural areas. Efforts to support and maintain mpox surveillance should be continued nationally in all areas of urbanicity to ensure all persons at risk for mpox get tested and treated. The current analysis demonstrated that racial and ethnic disparities in mpox incidence that were previously documented (10) were higher in absolute magnitude in urban areas and higher in relative magnitude in smaller urban and rural areas. This underscores the need for continued implementation of equity-based vaccination strategies focused on gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in urban areas where most mpox cases have been reported. In addition, comprehensive prevention strategies should include all persons at risk for mpox. CDC continues to recommend a full 2-dose course of the JYNNEOS vaccines for MSM and others at risk for Monkeypox virus exposure.

* Cases per 100,000 population, calculated using summed case counts and population size (persons aged 15–64 years) for all areas and for each level of urbanicity, multiplied by 100,000.
† Incidence during May–June and during October–December was combined because case counts were low during those periods.
§ Urban-rural classification of county of residence is based on the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties. The two nonmetro categories were combined into one rural (i.e., nonmetropolitan) category. Among the 29,311 cases reported in 2022, 135 were missing data on county of residence; therefore, incidences were calculated based on a total of 29,176 mpox cases.
¶ The number of cases in each period (numerator) was subtracted from the denominator for the following period when calculating incidence.
** Risk ratio was calculated by comparing large fringe urban, medium urban, small urban, and rural (nonmetropolitan) areas with large central urban areas.

FIGURE. Mpox incidence* among persons aged 15–64 years, by gender† (A), race and ethnicity§ (B), and urban-rural classification¶ of county of residence — United States, May 10–December 31, 2022
* Cases per 100,000 population. Risk was calculated by using summed case counts and population size (persons aged 15–64 years) by gender and race and ethnicity and each level of urban-rural classification, multiplied by 100,000.
† Methods for collecting gender information are not standardized across all jurisdictions. When self-reported gender was missing, current sex or sex assigned at birth was used, and gender identity was presumed to be cisgender. Among the 29,311 cases reported in 2022, 238 cases were missing data on gender (i.e., gender, sex, and sex assigned at birth). Among cases reported in cisgender men (27,726), 129 were missing information on county of residence, and risk for cisgender men was calculated from a total of 27,597 mpox cases among cisgender men. Among cases reported in cisgender women (822), two were missing information on county of residence, and incidence among cisgender women was calculated from a total of 820 mpox cases.
§ All persons who reported Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) ethnicity, regardless of race, were categorized as Hispanic. Persons who did not report ethnicity as Hispanic (including missing ethnicity) were categorized as non-Hispanic and reported race in the following categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American (Black), Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, and multiple races (more than one race category selected) or other race. This figure includes Black, Hispanic, and White racial and ethnic groups; incidence in all other groups was unreliable because of small sample sizes and were not included (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128433). Persons with missing data on ethnicity and race were categorized as missing or unknown. Among the 29,311 cases reported in 2022, 1,727 cases were missing data on race and ethnicity. Incidences among Black, Hispanic, and White persons were calculated using 9,151, 8,500, and 8,500 cases, respectively, because of the number of cases missing information on county of residence (20 of 9,171 [Black], 26 of 8,526 [Hispanic], and 29 of 8,079 [White]).
¶ Urban-rural classification of county of residence is based on the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties. The two nonmetro categories were combined into one rural (i.e., nonmetropolitan) category.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines help provide protection against medically attended COVID-19–associated illness. However, the durability of this protection is uncertain.
What is added by this report?
Among adults aged ≥18 years without immunocompromising conditions, bivalent booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19–associated hospitalization declined from 62% at 7–59 days postvaccination to 24% at 120–179 days compared with VE among unvaccinated adults. Among immunocompromised adults, lower bivalent booster VE was observed. However, bivalent booster VE was sustained against critical COVID-19–associated outcomes, including intensive care unit admission or death.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Adults should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines. Optional additional bivalent vaccine doses are available for older adults and persons with immunocompromising conditions.

On September 1, 2022, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a single bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster dose for persons aged ≥12 years who had completed at least a monovalent primary series. Early vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates among adults aged ≥18 years showed receipt of a bivalent booster dose provided additional protection against COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care visits and hospitalizations compared with that in persons who had received only monovalent vaccine doses (1); however, insufficient time had elapsed since bivalent vaccine authorization to assess the durability of this protection. The VISION Network* assessed VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalizations by time since bivalent vaccine receipt during September 13, 2022–April 21, 2023, among adults aged ≥18 years with and without immunocompromising conditions. During the first 7–59 days after vaccination, compared with no vaccination, VE for receipt of a bivalent vaccine dose among adults aged ≥18 years was 62% (95% CI = 57%–67%) among adults without immunocompromising conditions and 28% (95% CI = 10%–42%) among adults with immunocompromising conditions. Among adults without immunocompromising conditions, VE declined to 24% (95% CI = 12%–33%) among those aged ≥18 years by 120–179 days after vaccination. VE was generally lower for adults with immunocompromising conditions. A bivalent booster dose provided the highest protection, and protection was sustained through at least 179 days against critical outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission or in-hospital death. These data support updated recommendations allowing additional optional bivalent COVID-19 vaccine doses for certain high-risk populations. All eligible persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines.
The VISION Network evaluated VE of bivalent vaccines against COVID-19–associated hospitalization by length of time since receipt of the most recent dose during September 13, 2022–April 21, 2023, across five sites in seven states. VE methods used by the VISION Network have been previously described (2). For this analysis, adults aged ≥18 years with and without immunocompromising conditions who were hospitalized with COVID-19–like illness† were included if the patient received molecular testing (e.g., real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 during the 14 days preceding or up to 72 hours after hospital admission. Patients were categorized as immunocompromised or not based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) discharge codes.§ Patients were classified on the index date¶ as unvaccinated (no COVID-19 vaccine doses received), vaccinated with monovalent doses only, or vaccinated with one mRNA bivalent booster dose (regardless of number of previous monovalent doses received). Patients who received only monovalent doses were included if they received any combination of 1–4 doses (or 1–5 doses if immunocompromised) monovalent mRNA (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), or Novavax vaccine doses; recipients of a single monovalent mRNA dose or a single Novavax dose were excluded. In addition, patients were excluded if any vaccine dose was received <7 days before the index date, if a bivalent dose was received ≥180 days before the index date, or if >1 bivalent dose was received.** Patients aged <50 years without documented immunocompromising conditions were excluded if they had received >3 monovalent doses. Patients were considered to have critical illness if they were admitted to an ICU, died, or both.††
Absolute VE was estimated using a test-negative case-control design comparing the odds of vaccination (either bivalent booster or monovalent doses only versus being unvaccinated) among case- and control patients. Relative VE was calculated by comparing those who received a bivalent booster with those who received monovalent doses only. A combined model was generated and included patients who had only received monovalent vaccination ≥7 days before their index date, or a bivalent mRNA booster dose at 7–59, 60–119, or 120–179 days before their index date, compared with an unvaccinated reference group. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable logistic regression controlling for age, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day (days since January 1, 2021), and geographic region. Age and calendar day were modeled as natural cubic splines. VE was modeled separately for persons with and without immunocompromising conditions, by age group (18–64 and ≥65 years), and for each outcome (hospitalization and critical illness).§§ Analyses were conducted using R (version 4.2.2; The R Foundation). This study was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy and was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards at participating sites or under a reliance agreement with the Institutional Review Board of Westat, Inc.¶¶
Among 66,141 hospitalized patients without immunocompromising conditions who met inclusion criteria, 6,907 (10.4%) were case-patients and 59,234 (89.6%) were control patients (Table 1). Median age of case- and control patients was 76 years and 71 years, respectively. Among case- and control patients, 25.9% and 23.2% were unvaccinated, respectively; a bivalent vaccine dose had been received by 16.3% of case-patients and 20.6% of control patients. VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was similar across age groups, but waned over time, from 62% during the first 7–59 days after the bivalent dose to 24% by 120–179 days among adults aged ≥18 years (Table 2). Among those who received monovalent doses only, VE was 21% a median 376 days after the last dose. VE against critical illness was 69% during the 7–59 days after receipt of a bivalent dose and was more sustained (50% at 120–179 days after bivalent vaccination) than VE against hospitalization.
Among 18,934 hospitalized patients with immunocompromising conditions who met inclusion criteria, 1,834 (9.7%) were case-patients and 17,100 (90.3%) were control patients (Table 3); these persons represented 22.3% of the overall hospitalized population who met inclusion criteria. Median age of case- and control patients was 73 years and 70 years, respectively. Within this group, 17.1% of case-patients and 16.3% of control patients were unvaccinated; 21.0% of case-patients and 25.1% of control patients had received a bivalent dose. Among patients aged ≥18 years with immunocompromising conditions, VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was 28% during the first 7–59 days after receipt of the bivalent dose and declined to 13% by 120–179 days. VE for those who received monovalent doses only was 3% (median 355 days after the last dose). Estimates of relative and absolute VE were similar (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128421).

Discussion
In this multistate analysis of 85,075 hospitalizations of persons with COVID-19–like illness, bivalent doses were 62% effective among adults without immunocompromising conditions, and 28% effective in those with immunocompromising conditions in preventing COVID-19–associated hospitalization during the first 7–59 days after vaccination. Waning was evident in adults without immunocompromising conditions from 60–179 days (2–6 months) after vaccination. VE was more sustained against critical illness (50% at 120–179 days after vaccination) in adults without immunocompromising conditions, which suggests that bivalent vaccines provide durable protection against the most severe outcomes from COVID-19.
In this analysis, receipt of a bivalent dose boosted protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization that had waned since receipt of previous monovalent doses; however, protection afforded by a bivalent dose against COVID-19–associated hospitalization in adults without immunocompromising conditions waned in a similar pattern to that seen after receipt of a monovalent dose during Omicron predominance, with high initial VE and a decrease over time since the last dose. Among adults without immunocompromising conditions, bivalent VE was similar against COVID-19–associated hospitalization and critical illness within the first 2 months after vaccination but appeared to be more durable against critical illness, consistent with previous CDC research showing durable protection by monovalent mRNA vaccines against critical illness, defined as invasive mechanical ventilation or death (3). Although VE point estimates were lower among persons with immunocompromising conditions compared with those without such conditions, waning was not evident in this group, possibly because of heterogeneity in immune response among those with immunocompromising conditions or because of limited statistical power to detect differences by time. Previous analyses have shown differences in VE by type of immunocompromising condition (4); however, this analysis did not have sufficient statistical power to differentiate VE by condition type.
As of May 10, 2023, only one in five (20.5%) U.S. adults had received a bivalent booster dose.*** Among U.S. adults who previously received a monovalent vaccine but had yet to receive a bivalent mRNA booster, most received their last vaccine dose >1 year ago.††† Results of this analysis indicate that these adults might have relatively little remaining protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization compared with unvaccinated persons, although might have more remaining protection against critical illness.
On April 19, 2023, CDC amended recommendations to permit adults aged ≥65 years and those with immunocompromising conditions to receive ≥1 additional bivalent dose. In this analysis, waning VE patterns were the same in younger and older adults; however, rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death remain substantially higher among older adults, which suggests that an additional dose might confer additional benefit. In addition, although this analysis did not demonstrate clear evidence of waning VE in immunocompromised adults, overall VE among immunocompromised adults was lower than among those without immunocompromising conditions. Like older adults, persons with immunocompromising conditions remain at higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization and death and might benefit from additional bivalent doses, although this will require future evaluation.
The findings in this study are subject to at least six limitations. First, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was not accounted for in this analysis. According to a national seroprevalence survey, a large proportion of the population has now experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection; infection-induced immunity decreases the risk for future medically attended COVID-19 illness and might affect observed VE.§§§ The findings of this analysis should therefore be interpreted in the context of this underlying immunity as the incremental benefit provided by COVID-19 vaccination. Second, although all case-patients included in the analysis had COVID-19–like illness and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result at the time of the included hospitalization, some might have had relatively mild COVID-19 disease and been hospitalized because of reasons unrelated to COVID-19, which could lower measured VE. Third, although models adjusted for relevant confounders, such as age and calendar time, residual confounding is possible, including by behavioral differences, history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and use of COVID-19 treatments such as nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid). Fourth, differences in sublineage-specific VE could not be compared because of limited statistical power. Fifth, this analysis did not compare product-specific bivalent booster VE estimates. Finally, because these data are from seven states, the patients in this analysis might not be representative of the entire U.S. population.
In this study of durability of bivalent VE, bivalent doses helped provide protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization and critical disease. Although waning of protection was evident in some groups, VE was more sustained for critical illness, indicating the vaccines are continuing to help protect adults from the most severe COVID-19 outcomes. All adults should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines.

On March 30, 2021, during weekly analysis of sequenced isolates, the Tennessee Department of Health identified two Salmonella Duisburg isolates that had been determined to be closely related by whole genome sequencing (WGS). The specimens containing the isolates were from two patients who reported eating the same brand of cashew brie (a vegan brie cheese alternative) at the same restaurant. A search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Pathogen Detection Isolates Browser identified three additional Salmonella isolates, two from patients in California and one in Florida, that were closely related genetically to the Tennessee isolates. The California Department of Public Health confirmed that one patient consumed the same brand of cashew brie before becoming ill. The Florida Department of Health reported the patient followed a vegan diet, which excluded some potential food exposures. A multistate investigation to characterize illnesses and identify the outbreak source was initiated. Open-source access to WGS data through NCBI facilitated rapid investigation of this outbreak before it was large enough to be identified through standard multistate outbreak detection methods (1). Rapid detection, investigation, and product recall prevented additional illnesses.
A case was defined as a Salmonella infection with one of four outbreak strains (identified using WGS) with illness onset during December 1, 2020–May 9, 2021 (Figure). State and local officials interviewed patients about the foods they consumed before illness onset, including cashew brie, and where the foods were purchased. Product and environmental sampling were conducted at retail locations or at the sole cashew brie production facility identified during of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) traceback investigation. Outbreak strains of S. Chester, S. Typhimurium, and S. Urbana were included in the investigation because patients reported consuming cashew brie and cashew brie and component ingredients tested positive for these strains of Salmonella. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*
Overall, 20 cases were identified in four states: California (seven S. Typhimurium, three S. Chester, three S. Urbana, two S. Duisburg), Florida (one S. Chester, one S. Duisburg), Maryland (one S. Urbana), and Tennessee (two S. Duisburg). The median patient age was 26 years (range = 1–72 years); 65% were female. Five patients were hospitalized, and none died.
Among 19 patients who were interviewed, 15 reported eating the same brand of cashew brie during the week before illness onset. Thirty-six samples were collected by state and federal officials from component ingredients, in-process and finished products, and environmental swabs from the cashew brie production facility. Twenty-three (64%) samples yielded 51 Salmonella isolates, including 19 (95%) of 20 retail samples and four (25%) of 16 samples collected from the production facility. On the basis of these findings, the cashew brie producer voluntarily recalled all products. Four Salmonella strains were isolated from 51 food and environmental samples; the results of WGS analysis indicated that only S. Chester and S. Urbana detected in non-clinical samples were associated with human illness. In addition, S. Duisburg and S. Typhimurium were only isolated from clinical samples and not found in food or environmental samples.
On the basis of the food sample results and FDA traceback, the cashew ingredients used to make the brie products were the likely source of contamination. Review of cashew brie production revealed no lethality treatment (e.g., pasteurizing or irradiation) (2) before cashew processing. FDA worked with the cashew supplier to ensure potentially contaminated cashews were no longer on the market and the supplier implemented corrective actions.
Outbreaks associated with raw nut and seed products are well documented (3), and Salmonella outbreaks associated with cashew cheese have been reported (4). The lack of a lethality treatment for component ingredients can increase the risk of contamination in products that are served ready-to-eat and perceived as safe by the public. The identification of two persons who became ill after eating the same uncommon food at the same restaurant, paired with detection of a rare S. Duisburg serotype, led to an early hypothesis about the source of this outbreak. Open-source access to WGS data through NCBI enabled rapid investigation of this outbreak before it was large enough to be identified using the standard multistate outbreak detection methods (1). Rapid detection, investigation, and product recall prevented additional illnesses, given the detection of Salmonella in 95% of cashew brie products collected at retail locations during this investigation.

In 2021, among adults aged ≥18 years, women were more likely to take prescription medication for depression than were men (13.8% versus 7.0%). This pattern was found among non-Hispanic White (White) (18.1% versus 8.5%) and Hispanic or Latino (8.0% versus 3.7%) adults, but differences by sex were not statistically significant among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (6.7% versus 5.6%) and non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) (4.0% versus 2.4%) adults. Among men, Asian adults were less likely than White and Black adults to take prescription medication for depression, but the difference compared with Hispanic adults was not statistically significant. Among women, Asian adults were the least likely to take prescription medication for depression.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Persons with disability are less likely to be employed compared with persons without disability due to various barriers related to hiring practices, training opportunities, and daily working experiences.
What is added by this report?
During 2016–2020, 14.8% of currently employed U.S. adults aged 18–64 years from 35 states and Guam reported having a disability. Among 22 major occupation groups, the prevalence of any disability was highest for food preparation and serving-related professions (19.9%).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Workplace programs that address the training, education, and workplace needs of employees with disability might improve workers’ ability to enter, thrive in, and advance in a wider range of occupations.

In 2020, approximately 21.5 million employed U.S. adults aged 18–64 years had some form of disability. Although 75.8% of noninstitutionalized persons without disability aged 18–64 were employed, only 38.4% of their counterparts with disability were employed (1). Persons with disability have job preferences similar to persons without disability but might encounter barriers (e.g., lower average training or education levels, discrimination, or limited transportation options) that affect the types of jobs they hold (2,3). CDC analyzed 2016–2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 35 states and Guam to estimate disability prevalences, by type and occupation group, among currently employed U.S. adults aged 18–64 years. The highest adjusted disability prevalences were among workers in three of the 22 major occupation groups: food preparation and serving-related (19.9%); personal care and service (19.4%); and arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media (17.7%). Occupation groups with the lowest adjusted disability prevalences were business and financial operations (11.3%), health care practitioners and technicians (11.1%), and architecture and engineering (11.0%). The distributions of persons with and without disability differ across occupations. Workplace programs that address the training, education, and workplace needs of employees with disability might improve workers’ ability to enter, thrive in, and advance in a wider range of occupations.
BRFSS is an annual, random-digit–dialed telephone survey of noninstitutionalized, U.S. civilian residents aged ≥18 years. Conducted by states and territories, BRFSS gathers data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic illnesses and conditions, and use of health-related services.* The BRFSS questionnaire comprises standard and rotating core questions asked by all states and territories, as well as optionally administered topical modules and state-added questions. Thirty-five states and Guam† administered the optional industry and occupation module at least 1 year during 2016–2020. The median, combined mobile phone and landline response rate during the 2016–2020 survey years for all states, territories, and the District of Columbia ranged from 45.9% to 49.9%.§
To determine occupation, employed respondents were asked, “What kind of work do you do, for example, registered nurse, janitor, cashier, auto mechanic?”¶ Participants’ responses were recorded as free text and later coded by an auto-coding system or computer-assisted human coders** to one of 22 two-digit standard occupational classification major groups promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics.†† To assess disability, respondents were asked the six-item question set on hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living§§ in the BRFSS core questionnaire. Respondents replying “Yes” to at least one of these questions are considered to have a disability.
Among the 2016–2020 BRFSS participants who completed the industry and occupation optional module (1,053,331), 50.1% were currently employed and considered for analyses. Among respondents, those on active military duty (0.3%); those who were employed but reported “unpaid,” “retired,” or “disabled” as their occupation (0.1%); those who provided insufficient information to code occupation (6.9%); those who were missing information for occupation (7.4%); and adults ≥aged 65 years (11.5%) were excluded. The final analytic sample contained 395,141 respondents. Respondents with missing information for a specific disability type (2.2% missing for hearing, 2.4% for vision, 2.7% for cognitive, 2.7% for mobility, 2.7% for self-care, 2.9% for independent living, and 3.2% for any disability) were removed from the respective analyses. Prevalence of disability status and types were calculated for the 22 major occupation groups with and without adjustment for these sociodemographic variables: age group (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, or 55–64 years), sex, race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black or African American, non-Hispanic White, Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], or non-Hispanic other race or multiracial), and education level (less than high school diploma, high school diploma, some college, or college graduate or above). Adjusted prevalence estimates were obtained using log-linear regression analyses with a robust variance estimator while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Analyses were conducted with SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; RTI International) to account for the complex survey design. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶
Overall, 14.8% of currently employed U.S. adults aged 18–64 years reported having a disability (Table 1). Cognitive disability (7.0%) was the most frequently reported disability type; self-care disability (1.0%) was least frequently reported. Prevalences of all disability types were elevated among workers who had <a high school education, were Hispanic, were veterans, lacked access to health care coverage, or had a household income <$25,000 per year. Prevalence of the following types of disability were highest among workers aged 18–24 years: vision (3.6%), cognitive (13.9%), and independent living (4.4%). Prevalences were slightly higher among women than among men for any disability (15.5% versus 14.1%), vision (2.8% versus 2.5%), cognitive (7.8% versus 6.3%), mobility (5.4% versus 3.9%), and independent living (2.8% versus 1.7%) disability.
Prevalence of disability was highest in food preparation and serving-related (24.7%) and personal care and service (22.8%) occupation groups and lowest in the architecture and engineering group (8%) (Table 2). After adjustment for demographic characteristics (Table 3), occupation groups with the highest disability prevalences were food preparation and serving-related (19.9%); personal care and service (19.4%); and arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media (17.7%). Disability prevalences were lowest for business and financial operations (11.3%), health care practitioners and technicians (11.1%), and architecture and engineering (11.0%) (Table 3). The highest prevalences of specific disability types were in food preparation and serving-related for vision (4.2%), personal care and service for mobility (6.0%), and arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media for cognitive (10.8%). The prevalence of hearing disability was highest for the following occupational groups: installation, maintenance, and repair (4.2%); construction and extraction (3.8%); production (3.5%); protective services (3.5%); and farming, fishing, and forestry (3.5%).

Discussion
This report is the first to examine differences in disability prevalence by occupation group and includes adjustment for age, sex, race and ethnicity, and education. Persons with disability face employment disparities, a multidimensional issue involving barriers to finding and keeping jobs, including non-inclusive recruitment and hiring practices, lack of workplace communication and support, discrimination, and reduced workplace opportunities (4,5). Although the Americans with Disabilities Act protects the rights of most persons with disability who are employed or seeking jobs, additional resources could do more to shift attitudes and improve workplace equity (6). The higher percentage of persons with disability in service occupations (e.g., personal care and food preparation) might reflect better workplace programs, employees self-selecting into these jobs on the basis of perceived skill levels, less competition for these generally lower-wage jobs ($29,450–$33,620 mean annual wage compared with $58,260 for all occupations***), and other factors. Understanding differences in disability prevalence within and among occupation groups can help focus interventions and future research.
The proportion of working adults who reported a disability was highest among young adult workers and declined by age. This finding primarily reflects higher prevalences of cognitive disability among these younger workers. The ascertainment or prevalence of cognitive disabilities, which include autism spectrum differences, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, has increased in recent years, particularly among children and adolescents; this finding might explain the higher prevalence of self-reported cognitive disabilities among young adult workers in the current study (7). With early diagnosis and interventions, young persons with disability are likely better positioned for productive employment and successful integration into the workforce (8). Alternatively, the declining prevalence of cognitive disability in older age groups might reflect longer continued employment among workers without congenital or acquired cognitive disabilities.
The highest prevalences of hearing disability were reported among five occupation groups: installation, maintenance, and repair; construction and extraction; production; farming, fishing, and forestry; and protective service. Several occupations within these groups involve loud work processes and equipment that increase the risk for occupational noise exposure (9); findings in these groups might be linked to the higher rates of occupational hearing loss. During 2006–2010, prevalence and incidence of occupational hearing loss was highest for mining, which encompasses many extraction occupations and construction industries (9). In addition, limited hearing function might not be a substantial entry barrier for these occupations. Hearing conservation programs and use of hearing protection might be important for these occupation groups.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, BRFSS data are self-reported, and recall or social desirability bias might influence the responses. Second, BRFSS data are cross-sectional, so temporality and causality cannot be inferred, and the work-relatedness of any reported disability is unknown. Third, the major occupation groups are broad and include component occupations with differing disability profiles. Fourth, the data do not allow differentiation of part-time and full-time workers. Finally, the results are not nationally representative; data were available from 35 states and Guam.
Employer measures to increase workplace accessibility measures and training designed to meet the needs of employees with disability might broaden the range of occupations in which these workers can succeed. To support employment of persons with disability, the U.S. Department of Labor sponsors technical assistance resources including the Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion and Partnership on Employment and Accessible Technology.††† These programs offer services to help employers integrate persons with disability into the workforce, including a framework with strategies for building a disability-inclusive organization and improving workplace access to new and emerging technologies. An increase in home-based, part-time, and computer-based jobs during the previous decade has provided a wider variety of job types for persons with disability (3). Improving access to computer-based technologies for persons with disability could further this progress and increase the availability of higher-wage, skilled jobs. According to the Job Accommodation Network, approximately one half of job accommodations cost employers nothing, and three fourths of implemented job accommodations were found to be very or extremely effective.§§§ Additional research is needed to improve understanding of how employers can improve disability practices, including accommodations, interventions, and programs to promote the hiring and retention of employees with disability. Both employees with disabilities and employers can benefit from a more equitable and inclusive workforce.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
After being detected in May 2022, U.S. monkeypox (mpox) cases increased rapidly, peaking in August. Infection was primarily spread by sexual contact among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.
What is added by this report?
Rapid adaptation of smallpox preparedness systems and tools, and prioritized communication expertise from HIV prevention programs, were leveraged to reach communities at risk. In 1 year, more than 30,000 cases were reported and >1 million JYNNEOS vaccine doses were administered. Black and Hispanic persons represented 33% and 31% of cases, respectively; 87% of 42 fatal cases occurred in Black persons.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The U.S. risk for future mpox outbreaks remains. Ongoing surveillance, vaccination, and communication are important prevention tools, especially for Black and Hispanic persons in groups at risk.

Monkeypox (mpox) is a serious viral zoonosis endemic in west and central Africa. An unprecedented global outbreak was first detected in May 2022. CDC activated its emergency outbreak response on May 23, 2022, and the outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on July 23, 2022, by the World Health Organization (WHO),* and a U.S. Public Health Emergency on August 4, 2022, by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.† A U.S. government response was initiated, and CDC coordinated activities with the White House, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and many other federal, state, and local partners. CDC quickly adapted surveillance systems, diagnostic tests, vaccines, therapeutics, grants, and communication systems originally developed for U.S. smallpox preparedness and other infectious diseases to fit the unique needs of the outbreak. In 1 year, more than 30,000 U.S. mpox cases were reported, more than 140,000 specimens were tested, >1.2 million doses of vaccine were administered, and more than 6,900 patients were treated with tecovirimat, an antiviral medication with activity against orthopoxviruses such as Variola virus and Monkeypox virus. Non-Hispanic Black (Black) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons represented 33% and 31% of mpox cases, respectively; 87% of 42 fatal cases occurred in Black persons. Sexual contact among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) was rapidly identified as the primary risk for infection, resulting in profound changes in our scientific understanding of mpox clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and transmission dynamics. This report provides an overview of the first year of the response to the U.S. mpox outbreak by CDC, reviews lessons learned to improve response and future readiness, and previews continued mpox response and prevention activities as local viral transmission continues in multiple U.S. jurisdictions (Figure).

Epidemiology and Clinical Management of Cases
CDC partnered with state and local health departments to identify cases, analyze trends, and implement public health measures. Initial cases of mpox were associated with international travel, and cases associated with domestic transmission were quickly identified throughout all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Case numbers peaked in early August 2022; as of May 10, 2023, a total of 30,395 cases and 42 mpox-associated deaths were reported to CDC. An overwhelming majority of cases occurred among adult MSM and persons aged 21–55 years (Table). The outbreak disproportionately affected persons with HIV: 38% of cases occurred among persons with known HIV. Health disparities were observed among racial and ethnic minority groups, including Black (33%) and Hispanic persons (31%). These disparities have been more pronounced among fatal cases: among 38 mpox-associated deaths reported through March 7, 2023, Black persons accounted for 33 (87%). Among decedents with information available, 94% were immunocompromised because of HIV infection (1). CDC investigations found that in addition to male-to-male sexual contact, transmission also occurred, albeit uncommonly, through close household contact (including from a caregiver), heterosexual sexual contact, and injury from a sharp object (e.g., needles and scalpels) (2–5). Three cases occurred in infants born to mothers who reported peripartum mpox symptoms.
The clinical presentation of cases in this outbreak (caused by clade IIb) was often different from those in historic reports. Whereas disseminated skin lesions had been previously considered a hallmark of mpox (6), many cases in the current outbreak involved small, localized skin lesions, with some patients experiencing symptoms of proctitis. Before this outbreak, tecovirimat had only been administered for rare orthopoxvirus infections, and apart from animal studies, safety and effectiveness data were lacking. During the outbreak, however, tecovirimat was widely used under an expanded access, investigational new drug (IND) protocol.§ As of April 25, 2023, tecovirimat had been administered to 6,932 patients.
In September 2022, clinical consultants at CDC began to receive queries about treatment of patients who were severely ill with mpox, including persons with disseminated infections attributed to uncontrolled viral replication due to severe immunocompromise, particularly in persons with advanced HIV disease (7). Early optimization of immune status recovery with the administration of antiretroviral therapy was identified as important to improving patient outcomes.

Data-Driven Public Health Response
As part of national smallpox preparedness, CDC had previously developed a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved nonvariola orthopoxvirus (NVO) polymerase chain reaction test¶ for use at Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories in 68 U.S. locations; in May 2022, the capacity was 6,000 tests per week. By early July 2022, in collaboration with other government partners including FDA, NVO testing capacity was expanded to five commercial laboratory companies with broad U.S. coverage, thereby increasing national testing capacity to more than 80,000 specimens per week. As of April 6, 2023, a total of 144,209 NVO tests had been performed.
CDC successfully leveraged a SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance system for mpox, with 533 testing sites across the country. During July 6, 2022–April 16, 2023, a total of 20,928 wastewater samples were collected; results from 162 sites (30%) were positive at any time, and positive results were often associated with geographic areas where cases had been reported. Although numbers of mpox cases in the United States have continued to decline, continued testing remains useful as an early warning signal; during April 2023, only 1% of sites reported positive test results.
CDC deposited viral sequence data from the first U.S. case specimen into a public database** within 3 days of diagnosis. To date, CDC has analyzed more than 7,000 sequences within databases and deposited 366 whole genomes into public databases, thereby helping to monitor viral strains and potential tecovirimat resistant mutations; fewer than 1.0% of sequences examined had mutations associated with in vitro resistance. When such mutations were identified, CDC attempted viral isolation and cell culture–based testing to confirm resistance, and most resistant specimens were associated with severely immunocompromised patients on prolonged courses of tecovirimat treatment. The collection of sequence data, resistance testing results, and clinical outcomes will help guide future decisions about tecovirimat use and any regulatory actions by FDA.
JYNNEOS, a third-generation smallpox vaccine approved for both smallpox and mpox, was used widely during the response. Because of limited supplies during May–June 2022, CDC initially recommended that vaccine be prioritized for postexposure prophylaxis of known contacts; this was later expanded to include persons at potential risk for recent exposure. Decisions on equitable distribution of vaccine were made by the U.S. government and included consideration of the number of mpox cases per state and estimates of at-risk populations. Aided by FDA’s August 9, 2022, authorization for a dose-sparing intradermal administration strategy in adults, 1.2 million doses of JYNNEOS were administered during May 2022–May 2023, resulting in 37% first-dose coverage of the estimated at-risk population and 23% completed second-dose vaccination coverage, nationally. Rapidly conducted vaccine effectiveness (VE) analyses using data reported from state and local health officials demonstrated that mpox incidence among unvaccinated persons was 9.6 times higher than that among persons who received 2 doses of vaccine (8). A matched case control study found an adjusted VE of 85.9% for 2 doses and 75.2% for 1 dose across all routes of administration, with a lower VE of 70.2% among fully vaccinated immunocompromised persons (9); no new or unexpected safety concerns were identified, and serious adverse events were rare (10). Outbreak data were instrumental in the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ 2023 vote†† in favor of the use of JYNNEOS for adults at risk for acquiring mpox during an outbreak. The course of the outbreak during the ensuing months and years will help guide future vaccine administration policies.

Clinician and Community Engagement and Communications
To familiarize U.S. health care professionals with mpox, CDC released seven Health Alert Network notices (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han) and held six Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity calls, beginning in May 2022, to provide clinicians with up-to-date information, including images of the different stages of mpox rash on various skin tones, and to communicate about nontraditional rash locations including anal-genital and oropharyngeal sites. Regular updates to clinical care recommendations provided rapid dissemination of advancing knowledge of diagnostics and vaccine and therapeutics use.
A health equity approach guided CDC’s response; an effort to ensure that the voices of affected communities were heard and honored was central to response activities. CDC tested messages and participated in approximately 50 community engagement and listening sessions to develop and refine mpox-related communications. Listening sessions included 26 owners and operators of sex-on-premises venues, 16 sex workers, and 28 harm reduction organizations. Early dissemination of key messaging via dating apps and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other (LGBTQ+) media targeted communities disproportionately affected by mpox. CDC resources were adopted and promoted by some prominent LGBTQ+ advocates and influencers, amplifying prevention messages. By August 2022, a survey of MSM indicated that 50% of respondents reported a reduction in the numbers of sex partners, one-time sexual encounters, and sex with partners met on dating apps or at sex-on-premises venues, which coincided with a significant decrease in reported mpox cases (11). Effectively communicating prevention messages to at-risk populations, including the importance of vaccination, is a critical component of continued prevention efforts.
Recognizing racial and ethnic disparities in incidence, illness outcomes, and vaccination coverage, CDC partnered with community organizations in 22 locations to pilot innovative vaccine equity projects to improve vaccination among disproportionately affected populations, including administering >25,000 vaccine doses at various locations across the nation, such as the largest HIV-related conference in the United States, at large festivals and Pride events, and through mobile vans (12,13).

Lessons Learned and Future Challenges
Understanding the trajectory and subsequent mitigation of the outbreak was dependent upon collection and analysis of timely and reliable data on mpox cases, laboratory testing, and administration of countermeasures, such as vaccine and treatments that were tracked by state and local partners and health care providers and reported to CDC. Multiple successes were recognized, as were learning moments that can be studied and leveraged, which could lead to a more robust response to future epidemics. Control of the mpox outbreak was dependent on years of research related to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development and approval, surveillance systems enhancements, and community partnerships. This type of research and preparation needs to continue for smallpox, mpox, and other biothreats. Public health agencies at all levels and the affected communities have made substantial progress in the year since the outbreak began, but the outbreak is not over. The United States remains at risk for increasing mpox transmission and reignited outbreaks. Continued prevention efforts are needed to interrupt viral transmission in countries where the virus is not endemic and to control transmission in areas were zoonotic mpox is endemic.
Based on decades of U.S. smallpox research, an FDA-approved test and surveillance network, as well as approved vaccines and therapeutics, were already in place and available to be used for mpox. Limited early availability of JYNNEOS vaccine required careful allocation to facilitate receipt of vaccine by persons at highest risk for exposure, with eligibility criteria expanding as additional vaccine supplies became available. This outbreak underscored the need to anticipate higher demand for JYNNEOS in the event of a future smallpox or mpox outbreak, as well as for advance planning for equitable distribution of and access to limited or scarce resources. The 2022–2023 mpox outbreak was driven by sexual contact as the most common mode of transmission, primarily among MSM populations. High rates of HIV in the affected population, as well as risks for significant side effects associated with ACAM2000 (a second generation smallpox vaccine) drove interest in JYNNEOS during this outbreak. The mpox outbreak response highlighted that early reporting requirements for the tecovirimat IND were too cumbersome for practical use during an outbreak; accordingly, CDC worked to simplify IND reporting requirements, reducing barriers to therapeutic administration.
Substantial LRN laboratory capacity was in place at the start of the mpox outbreak; however, easier access to and higher capacity for testing through commercial platforms was requested by providers. CDC worked quickly with other federal partners and commercial laboratories to rapidly increase national testing capacity and access within 2 months. These government and commercial partnerships were crucial during the height of the outbreak; similar partnerships are important to consider in future outbreak preparedness and response planning.
Because of the atypical clinical presentation and transmission dynamics in this outbreak compared with historic reports of mpox, rapid sharing of clear information was essential, and CDC’s ability to rapidly develop and disseminate messages and tools for partners during the mpox response hinged on leveraging expertise from sexual health and HIV prevention programs. Early engagement with and respect for persons at risk for mpox were central to CDC’s communications strategy with a focus on cultural sensitivity and competency (14). Rapid epidemiologic analyses and incorporation of findings into changing messages for risk reduction were also critical. However, even with these efforts, early messaging might have missed opportunities to improve understanding of sexual transmission risks among MSM. Communications evolved with the outbreak, with bidirectional feedback from communities and community champions critical to the learning process. CDC also relied on frequent communications with federal officials, state and local health officials, and WHO to ensure timely sharing of new information and joint prioritization.
During the outbreak, persons from racial and ethnic minority groups accounted for a large number of cases and severe outcomes, and a low proportion of persons receiving vaccines. Concerted efforts to reach affected communities with vaccination events mitigated but did not overcome these disparities. Equitable access to prevention and care, a critical component of strategy and policy, is ideally addressed before an outbreak but is also critical during the response. Assuring continued access to vaccines for persons at increased risk for mpox, increasing second-dose coverage, and closing equity gaps remain important goals to reduce the risk for mpox resurgence in the United States and worldwide, including having an ample supply of vaccine in countries in Africa with endemic disease to rapidly respond to outbreaks.
Research to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of JYNNEOS for mpox prevention is ongoing, with a need to determine whether booster immunization is needed. New medical countermeasures are being investigated, as well as continued molecular surveillance of the virus to monitor for mutations that might affect efficacy of current therapeutics. Studies at the animal-human interface for mpox continue, including the identification of animal reservoirs in countries that have historically had endemic mpox. New diagnostic assays, including specific detection of antibodies to the virus causing mpox in humans and animals, are in development.
The elimination of human transmission is a near-term goal for many countries where mpox is not endemic.§§ The association of mpox cases with HIV infection highlights the need for a syndemic approach to care for HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and mpox in the context of comprehensive sexual health care. The mpox outbreak occurred with little warning, peaked quickly, and waned 5 months after the first case was reported in the United States. Even as WHO declared the outbreak no longer a public health emergency on May 11, 2023, a cluster of mpox cases occurred in Chicago, Illinois, including among some previously vaccinated persons, demonstrating the ongoing risk for new cases and outbreaks and the need for continued vigilance and prevention efforts.¶¶ CDC continues to focus on surveillance, vaccination, and communication for populations at risk for mpox as important prevention tools.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for JYNNEOS vaccine against monkeypox (mpox) are limited. To date, no VE estimates by route of administration or for immunocompromised persons have been published.
What is added by this report?
In this study, adjusted VE was 75% for 1 dose and 86% for 2 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine, indicating substantial protection against mpox, irrespective of route of administration or immunocompromise status.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Persons at high risk for mpox exposure should be vaccinated with the recommended 2-dose JYNNEOS series.

As of March 31, 2023, more than 30,000 monkeypox (mpox) cases had been reported in the United States in an outbreak that has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender persons (1). JYNNEOS vaccine (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 for the prevention of smallpox and mpox via subcutaneous injection as a 2-dose series (0.5 mL per dose, administered 4 weeks apart) (2). To expand vaccine access, an Emergency Use Authorization was issued by FDA on August 9, 2022, for dose-sparing intradermal injection of JYNNEOS as a 2-dose series (0.1 mL per dose, administered 4 weeks apart) (3). Vaccination was available to persons with known or presumed exposure to a person with mpox (postexposure prophylaxis [PEP]), as well as persons at increased risk for mpox or who might benefit from vaccination (preexposure mpox prophylaxis [PrEP]) (4). Because information on JYNNEOS vaccine effectiveness (VE) is limited, a matched case-control study was conducted in 12 U.S. jurisdictions,† including nine Emerging Infections Program sites and three Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity sites,§ to evaluate VE against mpox among MSM and transgender adults aged 18–49 years. During August 19, 2022–March 31, 2023, a total of 309 case-patients were matched to 608 control patients. Adjusted VE was 75.2% (95% CI = 61.2% to 84.2%) for partial vaccination (1 dose) and 85.9% (95% CI = 73.8% to 92.4%) for full vaccination (2 doses). Adjusted VE for full vaccination by subcutaneous, intradermal, and heterologous routes of administration was 88.9% (95% CI = 56.0% to 97.2%), 80.3% (95% CI = 22.9% to 95.0%), and 86.9% (95% CI = 69.1% to 94.5%), respectively. Adjusted VE for full vaccination among immunocompromised participants was 70.2% (95% CI = −37.9% to 93.6%) and among immunocompetent participants was 87.8% (95% CI = 57.5% to 96.5%). JYNNEOS is effective at reducing the risk for mpox. Because duration of protection of 1 versus 2 doses remains unknown, persons at increased risk for mpox exposure should receive the 2-dose series as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP),¶ regardless of administration route or immunocompromise status.
A matched case-control study was conducted in 12 U.S. jurisdictions. Case-patients had a confirmed or probable Monkeypox virus or Orthopoxvirus diagnosis on or after August 19, 2022; they were identified or verified through jurisdiction health departments’ case registries. Control patients had visited a sexual health, HIV care, or HIV PrEP clinic on or after August 19, 2022, and did not receive an mpox diagnosis; they were identified through active and passive recruitment approaches at local clinics in each jurisdiction.** Participation was restricted to sexually active†† persons aged 18–49 years who self-identified as MSM or transgender. Eligible participants were invited to complete a survey administered online or by telephone in English or Spanish. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics, mpox vaccination, mpox diagnosis, immunocompromising conditions, and exposure history anchored to an index date, defined as date of positive test result (case-patients) or clinic visit (control patients). Survey responses were recorded in REDCap (version 13.1.26; Vanderbilt University). Participants’ vaccination status was verified using state vaccination registries, where available. Participants were categorized as fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, or unvaccinated based on the number of JYNNEOS doses they received relative to their index date.§§
Each case-patient was matched with up to four control patients based on state or region¶¶ and index date (within 4 weeks). Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios evaluating the association between vaccination status and case- or control patient status. The adjusted model accounted for covariates identified a priori, including age, race and ethnicity, immunocompromising conditions,*** and close contact with a person with known mpox.††† VE was calculated as (1 – odds ratio) x 100%. VE estimates were stratified a priori by immunocompromise status and route of vaccine administration (subcutaneous, intradermal, or heterologous [i.e., a different route for each dose]). Analyses were conducted using the survival package in R statistical software (version 4.2.2; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§
Among 1,414 respondents, 1,127 (86.1%) met the minimum data element requirements¶¶¶ for inclusion in the analysis, and 309 (89.6%) of 345 case-patients and 608 (77.7%) of 782 control patients were matched. A larger proportion of case- than control patients identified as non-Hispanic Black or African American (27.2% versus 16.9%) or Hispanic or Latino (32.4% versus 23.4%) (Table 1). Larger proportions of case- than control patients reported experiencing recent homelessness (7.9% versus 2.7%), engaging in transactional sex (9.1% versus 3.3%), and living with HIV (48.1% versus 24.0%); among participants who did not report living with HIV, a smaller proportion of case- than control patients reported using HIV PrEP (54.4% versus 66.8%). Larger proportions of case- than control patients were classified as immunocompromised (46.6% versus 26.0%) and reported recent close contact with a known mpox case (23.0% versus 3.9%).
Among the 917 participants included in the VE analysis, 206 (22.5%) were fully vaccinated, 295 (32.2%) were partially vaccinated, and 416 (45.4%) were unvaccinated. Unadjusted VE was 75.7% for partial vaccination and 87.4% for full vaccination (Table 2). After adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, immunocompromise status, and close contact with a person with known mpox, VE was 75.2% for partial vaccination and 85.9% for full vaccination. Among partially vaccinated participants, adjusted VE by route of administration was 77.0% for subcutaneous and 80.6% for intradermal administration. Among fully vaccinated participants, adjusted VE was 88.9% for subcutaneous, 80.3% for intradermal, and 86.9% for heterologous administration. Among participants with an immunocompromising condition, adjusted VE was 51.0% for partial vaccination and 70.2% for full vaccination, both with negative lower 95% CI bounds. Among participants without an immunocompromising condition, adjusted VE was 72.1% for partial vaccination and 87.8% for full vaccination.

Discussion
In this real-world assessment of JYNNEOS VE in 12 U.S. jurisdictions during the 2022 mpox outbreak, adjusted VE against mpox was 75.2% for partial vaccination and 85.9% for full vaccination. The results from this study are consistent with those from previous studies evaluating vaccine performance or effectiveness (5–7) and strengthen the evidence base supporting vaccination with JYNNEOS for protection against mpox.
This study is the first to estimate VE by route of administration. Similar point estimates and overlapping CIs for estimates by route of administration suggest that, in the context of the current outbreak, vaccine administration by any route provides comparable protection against mpox.
This study also estimated VE for immunocompromised persons. Although the lower bounds of the 95% CIs for immunocompromised persons were negative (indicating the need for more data to obtain more precise estimates), adjusted VE estimates were 51.0% for partial vaccination and 70.2% for full vaccination among immunocompromised participants, and 72.1% for partial and 87.8% for full vaccination among immunocompetent participants. Overlapping CIs for these VE estimates suggest no difference by immunocompromise status, although the lower VE point estimates in participants who are immunocompromised might suggest a less robust response to the vaccine. Persons with immunocompromising conditions might mount a less effective immune response after vaccination**** and might choose to take additional precautions to reduce their risk for mpox infection, such as reducing their number of sex partners and one-time sexual encounters (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, selection bias was likely present because participation was voluntary and recruitment for controls took place in sexual health, HIV care, or HIV PrEP clinics. Second, survey data were self-reported and might be subject to social desirability or recall bias, particularly because the time between index event and survey completion varied. Third, vaccination status could have been misclassified if participants were vaccinated outside of their jurisdiction or if a participant’s vaccination dates were incorrectly reported. Fourth, immunocompromise status was based on self-report; these persons might not be considered immunocompromised by clinical standards. In addition, because of limited data on HIV status, some participants with well-controlled HIV might have been incorrectly classified as immunocompromised. Fifth, some jurisdictions had challenges recruiting controls. As a result, 35 case-patients were not matched and were excluded from the analysis. Sixth, because of small sample sizes, VE for PEP could not be estimated. Finally, although the 12 U.S. jurisdictions included in this study covered a broad geographic area, data might not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population.
Vaccination is an important tool for preventing mpox,†††† and this report demonstrates that the JYNNEOS vaccine is effective at reducing risk for mpox; however, additional precautions to reduce exposure should be considered, particularly among immunocompromised persons (8). Both 1 and 2 doses provided substantial protection against mpox, irrespective of route of administration. However, additional research is needed to assess duration of protection, which might differ by number of doses or route of administration. JYNNEOS vaccination coverage among persons at risk is low, and many eligible persons have not received both doses (9–10). For optimal protection, persons at risk for mpox should receive the 2-dose series, as recommended by ACIP, irrespective of administration route.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The JYNNEOS vaccine was deployed in a national and state vaccination campaign during the 2022 monkeypox (mpox) outbreak. Postexposure prophylaxis and vaccination of persons at highest risk (primarily men who have sex with men) were prioritized. Evidence of vaccine effectiveness (VE) from controlled studies has been limited.
What is added by this report?
A comparison of men aged ≥18 years who received a diagnosis of mpox during July 24–October 31 in New York to controls with rectal gonorrhea or primary syphilis, based on systematically collected surveillance data, found adjusted combined 1-dose (received ≥14 days earlier) or 2-dose VE of 75.7%.
What are the implications for public health practice?
These findings support recommended 2-dose JYNNEOS vaccination consistent with CDC and New York State Department of Health guidance.

In 2022, an international Monkeypox virus outbreak, characterized by transmission primarily through sexual contact among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), resulted in 375 monkeypox (mpox) cases in the state of New York outside of New York City (NYC).*,† The JYNNEOS vaccine (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic), licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against mpox as a 2-dose series, with doses administered 4 weeks apart,§ was deployed in a national vaccination campaign.¶ Before this outbreak, evidence to support vaccine effectiveness (VE) against mpox was based on human immunologic and animal challenge studies (1–3). New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) conducted a case-control study to estimate JYNNEOS VE against diagnosed mpox in New York residents outside of NYC, using data from systematic surveillance reporting. A case-patient was defined as a man aged ≥18 years who received a diagnosis of mpox during July 24–October 31, 2022. Contemporaneous control patients were men aged ≥18 years with diagnosed rectal gonorrhea or primary syphilis and a history of male-to-male sexual contact, without mpox. Case-patients and control patients were matched to records in state immunization systems. JYNNEOS VE was estimated as 1 – odds ratio (OR) x 100, and JYNNEOS vaccination status (vaccinated versus unvaccinated) at the time of diagnosis was compared, using conditional logistic regression models that adjusted for week of diagnosis, region, patient age, and patient race and ethnicity. Among 252 eligible mpox case-patients and 255 control patients, the adjusted VE of 1 dose (received ≥14 days earlier) or 2 doses combined was 75.7% (95% CI = 48.5%–88.5%); the VE for 1 dose was 68.1% (95% CI = 24.9%–86.5%) and for 2 doses was 88.5% (95% CI = 44.1%–97.6%). These findings support recommended 2-dose JYNNEOS vaccination consistent with CDC and NYSDOH guidance.
The first mpox case in New York outside NYC was reported on June 2, 2022. On June 28, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response announced a phased, jurisdictional rollout of the JYNNEOS vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile, prioritizing postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and vaccination of persons with recent or ongoing risks for mpox infection.** The first New York allocation of 2,206 vials was received July 6. By September 12, a total of 35,666 vials had been delivered.†† NYSDOH coordinated vaccine distribution in New York outside NYC with local health departments and community organizations.
All mpox, gonorrhea, and syphilis diagnoses in New York outside of NYC are reportable to NYSDOH.§§ Reports are investigated by public health staff members and entered into the Communicable Disease Electronic Surveillance System (CDESS). Case-patients were males at birth aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed mpox from whom specimens were collected during July 24–October 31, 2022 (2 weeks after vaccine campaign launch through the end of mandatory dose reporting to the New York State Immunization Information System [NYSIIS]). Control patients were males at birth aged ≥18 years with rectal gonorrhea or primary syphilis diagnosed within the same time frame as the mpox cases, and with presumptive sexual contact with a male or transgender person.¶¶
Demographic characteristics of case- and control patients were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Pearson’s chi-square tests. Case- and control patient records in CDESS were matched to NYSIIS*** by name and date of birth to ascertain JYNNEOS vaccination status and history, an approach similar to that used in a COVID-19 VE study (4). Vaccination status was categorized into four groups, including one unvaccinated group (no JYNNEOS doses received) or one of three vaccinated groups: 1) with mpox or sexually transmitted infection (STI) specimen collected <14 days after receipt of dose 1; 2) ≥14 days after dose 1; or 3) after dose 2 (5,6). To estimate adjusted VE, conditional logistic regression models of case- and control patient vaccination status and dose history were used, matched on diagnosis week, with covariates including age, race and ethnicity, and region within New York outside NYC. VE values (with 95% CIs) were estimated as 1 – OR x 100, comparing each vaccinated category with the unvaccinated group.††† Four sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine uncertainties in case- and control patient definitions. All 1-dose VE estimates were reported for doses received ≥14 days earlier, unless otherwise specified. Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This analysis was determined to be nonresearch by the NYSDOH Institutional Review Board.
During June 2–December 31, 2022, a total of 375 mpox cases were reported to NYSDOH and the administration of 27,385 JYNNEOS doses was recorded in NYSIIS, including 16,769 (61%) first doses and 10,616 (39%) second doses (Figure). The reported number of cases peaked in mid-August, 5 weeks after launch of the JYNNEOS vaccination campaign. During July 24–October 31, a total of 252 male mpox case-patients and 255 STI control patients (175 with rectal gonorrhea and 80 with primary syphilis) met inclusion criteria. The age distribution was similar for case-patients (median = 32.1 years; range = 18.5–66.4 years) and control patients (median = 31.3 years; range = 19.4–74.3 years) (p = 0.47). Among persons with known ethnicity, Hispanic ethnicity was more prevalent among case-patients (43.6%) than among controls (18.9%; p<0.001) (Table 1). In addition, 68.7% of case-patients lived in the metropolitan region outside NYC, compared with 35.7% of control patients (p<0.001).
Among the 252 mpox case-patients, 22 (8.7%) had received the JYNNEOS vaccine, including 10 (4.0%) who had received 1 dose <14 days earlier, 10 (4.0%) who had received 1 dose ≥14 days earlier, and two (0.8%) who had received 2 doses; 230 (91.3%) were not vaccinated (Table 2). Among 255 control patients, 51 (20%) had received the JYNNEOS vaccine, including 42 (16.5%) who received an STI diagnosis ≥14 days after receiving 1 dose (23; 9.0%) or 2 doses (19; 7.5%). This corresponded to adjusted VE for combined 1 dose or 2 doses of 75.7% (95% CI = 48.5%–88.5%); 1-dose VE was 68.1% (95% CI = 24.9%–86.5%) and 2-dose VE was 88.5% (95% CI = 44.1%–97.6%). No significant VE was observed within 13 days of receipt of dose 1.
The first of the four sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128142) excluded men aged ≥50 years, who might have received a smallpox vaccine before routine nonmilitary U.S. vaccination ended in 1972; this analysis detected nearly identical VE as the main sensitivity analysis. The second sensitivity analysis included 71 secondary syphilis diagnoses in the control group, resulting in 1-dose or 2-dose combined VE of 64.8% (95% CI = 26.7%–83.1%). Among control patients, 213 (83.5%) had known reasons for testing: 88 (41.3%) because of symptoms, 19 (8.9%) because of partner referral, 103 (48.4%) for screening, and three (1.4%) for another reason. The third analysis restricted control patients to those persons testing for symptoms or referrals; 1-dose or 2-dose VE was 63.6% (95% CI = 8.0%–85.6%).§§§ The final sensitivity analysis limited observations to persons with known race and ethnicity and estimates increased modestly from the primary analysis, with 1-dose or 2-dose VE of 80.5% (95% CI = 56.1%–91.3%).

Discussion
Receipt of 1 or 2 JYNNEOS doses was effective in preventing diagnosed mpox infection, with higher 2-dose VE of >88%. These findings support the approved use of the JYNNEOS vaccine as a 2-dose series for mpox prevention and, amid ongoing sexually related transmission of mpox, incorporating the JYNNEOS vaccine into a broader program of sexual health services.
Before this outbreak, evidence to support VE against mpox was based on human immunologic and animal challenge studies (1–3). Since the outbreak began, new estimates have been generated. CDC used multi-jurisdictional data on mpox patient vaccination status to estimate 9.6- and 7.4-fold incidence for unvaccinated at-risk males compared with 2-dose and 1-dose recipients, respectively (5,6). A similar United Kingdom analysis found 78% 1-dose VE,¶¶¶ and an Israeli cohort study found 86% 1-dose VE (7). These cohort studies are subject to biases; at-risk unvaccinated population estimates are uncertain and afford limited ability to control for confounding variables. For example, incidence among vaccinated persons might be reduced by persons with lower risk behaviors seeking vaccination, inflating incidence risk ratios and VE estimates. Case-control studies such as this one and others (8) can build in control for both risk factors and test-seeking, which was achieved in this study by sampling persons with diagnosed infections.
VE was moderately high according to the results of all sensitivity analyses. Lower VE observed when including secondary syphilis might reflect control patients with more remote risk behaviors or different clinical presentation. Lower VE when limiting control patients to persons who had testing because of symptoms or partner referral could reflect intended removal of persons at lower risk seeking health care or inadvertent removal of persons at higher risk accessing frequent screening.
No protection was present for 1 dose received <14 days earlier; however, this interval could include both persons who received PEP and those who were exposed after vaccination but before a protective immune response might be anticipated. Additional studies are needed to resolve these scenarios, with control groups better selected for studying PEP.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, uncontrolled confounding might remain, which could lead to under- or overestimation of VE. For example, some factors might positively link persons more likely to acquire mpox and receive the JYNNEOS vaccine, compared with the overall population of persons who acquire an STI. These factors would render observed VE as underestimates. Second, JYNNEOS vaccine doses might be undercounted. Reporting doses to NYSIIS was optional before the July 29 state executive order mandated reporting; however, reporting was determined to be mostly complete via inventory surveys.**** Doses administered to New York residents while out of state are not reported to NYSIIS, unless entered afterward by an in-state provider. Both undercounts would cause nondifferential misclassification of coverage, lowering observed VE. Third, as with other studies, it was not possible to account for postvaccination behavior change; however, to the extent that vaccinated case- and control patients became infected in the postvaccination period, observed VE would represent unbiased estimates for those with ongoing risk. Fourth, the outbreak trajectory precluded determining duration of protection. Fifth, data were insufficient to calculate VE by subcutaneous or intradermal administration modes or by HIV-related factors. Finally, the findings describe diagnosed, symptomatic mpox, but not prevention of asymptomatic infection or secondary transmission.
The mpox outbreak rapidly declined during summer 2022 after extensive public health and vaccination efforts and individual behavior changes (9). How much decline was attributable to VE, behavior changes, or seasonal variation in viral transmission or behavior is unknown†††† (9,10). Nonetheless, this study leveraged systematically collected patient and vaccine registry data to demonstrate a protective effect of the JYNNEOS vaccine, controlling for outbreak trajectory, among persons with behavioral risk. Global mpox spread continues and might accelerate during summer 2023, given remaining unvaccinated persons with behavioral risk§§§§ These findings support recommended 2-dose JYNNEOS vaccination consistent with CDC and NYSDOH guidance.¶¶¶¶

¶¶ Persons reported as male mpox case-patients were presumed to be MSM in this analysis (among 70% of patients with recorded sexual activity within 21 days, 85% reported male or transgender partners). All rectal gonorrhea diagnoses were included (among 63% of patients with partner data, 98% reported male or transgender partners). For primary syphilis, diagnoses were excluded if the person reported no male-to-male sexual contact (84% reported risk factor data).
*** Doses of JYNNEOS vaccine administered in New York outside of NYC are reportable to NYSIIS. Doses given to persons in NYC are reported to the Citywide Immunization Registry, which sends all non-NYC New York residents’ records to NYSIIS.
††† Two separate models considered the main four-level dose classification and one that combined “≥14 days after dose 1” and “dose 2” into a single level.
§§§ STIs detected via asymptomatic screening might have been acquired several weeks or months previously, whereas symptomatic STIs are likely more recently acquired. Thus, persons with STIs detected via asymptomatic screening might be at lower current risk for mpox than are persons with symptomatic STIs. Also, persons with health-seeking behaviors (such as STI screening) might be more likely to receive the JYNNEOS vaccine. Alternatively, because asymptomatic screening is recommended annually for all sexually active MSM and every 3–6 months for those with increased behavioral risk, sampling routinely screening MSM might select for those at elevated risk for mpox. https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/default.htm

On February 1, 2022, the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) Department of Health (VIDOH) was notified of a confirmed case of Legionnaires disease in an adult U.S. resident (Figure). The patient, a man aged 55 years, returned to his U.S. state of residence from leisure travel in USVI on January 22 and developed a cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue on January 23. On January 29, he was hospitalized for shortness of breath and received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result at admission. The combination of the patient’s symptoms and recent travel history prompted administration of a urinary antigen test (UAT) for Legionnaires disease specific to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1); a positive result was returned on January 31. Inpatient treatment administered for COVID-19 pneumonia and Legionnaires disease included remdesivir, oral levofloxacin, oral and intravenous steroid therapy, and as-needed use of a bronchodilator inhaler and an expectorant. Remdesivir was discontinued during inpatient treatment because of elevated liver enzymes. The patient recovered and was discharged on February 2.
Interviews with the patient indicated that he had stayed at a privately owned vacation rental property during January 15–22. As is the case with most USVI residential properties, rainwater collected into a cistern under the home was the property’s potable water source (1), which supplies water for drinking, bathing, a swimming pool, and two hot tubs. Water is heated by a solar water heater, which does not allow for water temperature control. The property owner reported that no routine chlorine treatment or water filtration systems were used to maintain the potable water source during the patient’s stay.
On February 3, VIDOH requested assistance from CDC’s Legionella program to conduct environmental sampling and testing for Legionella bacteria. Twenty-five bulk water, swab, and cartridge filter samples were collected at the property. L. pneumophila nonserogroup 1 was detected in 11 locations, including one hot tub cartridge filter, all showers, the two sampled bathroom sinks, and two critical control points: the cistern and solar water heater. Lp1, the only strain detectable by UAT, was not detected in environmental samples.
No respiratory specimen was collected from the patient, which would have been needed to detect and directly link an L. pneumophila nonserogroup 1 infection to the property; however, L. pneumophila of any serogroup can infect humans, and any environment hospitable to L. pneumophila nonserogroup 1 is also hospitable to Lp1 (2,3). Thus, even without a direct linkage of the L. pneumophila strain detected in the patient to the property, the high prevalence (44%) of samples positive for L. pneumophila nonserogroup 1 in environmental samples collected at a single time point revealed favorable environmental conditions for widespread, uncontrolled Legionella growth of multiple serogroups at the property.
Given the detection of L. pneumophila nonserogroup 1 at multiple sampling locations on the same day, VIDOH provided recommendations to disinfect the property’s plumbing system and implement water system maintenance (installing a multistage ultraviolet filtration system and performing routine chlorination). The property owner completed remediation recommendations during February 5–6. However, a request by VIDOH for retesting in September was declined by the property owner, highlighting a gap in VIDOH’s ability to evaluate maintenance effectiveness.
Vacation rental properties represent a growing proportion of the accommodation types identified in U.S. travel-associated Legionnaires disease cases and outbreaks (4). In resource-constrained settings such as USVI, commonly recommended water quality maintenance strategies (e.g., controlled temperature water heating and multistage water filtration) are not easily implemented, highlighting territory-specific potable water maintenance and testing needs. In light of these maintenance challenges, and that an estimated 90% of USVI residences rely on cisterns as their potable water source, the environmental assessment and sampling results of this investigation underscore the potential for undetected Legionnaires disease cases among USVI residents and travelers (1). Patients with clinical signs consistent with Legionnaires disease such as shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, and a history of travel to USVI should be tested for Legionella, even if, as was the case for the patient described in this report, another respiratory virus test result is positive. When cases are identified, environmental assessment and sampling, remediation strategy implementation, and timely postremediation testing are central to ensuring treatment success. VIDOH continues to work with CDC’s Legionella program to improve territory Legionnaires disease case surveillance, Legionella environmental assessment and sampling practices, and educational outreach to vacation rental owners.

In 2021, 51.6% of all U.S. children and adolescents aged 5–17 years received free or reduced-cost meals at school during the previous 12 months; NH Black or African American (66.2%) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (64.4%) children and adolescents were more likely to receive free or reduced-cost meals at school than were NH White (42.7%) children and adolescents, with NH Asian (30.9%) children and adolescents having the lowest percentage. The same pattern was observed for children and adolescents in families with income ≥185% of the FPL, but the observed difference in receiving free or reduced-cost meals between Hispanic and NH White children and adolescents was not significant for the lower-income group. Children and adolescents in families with incomes <185% of the FPL were more likely to receive free or reduced-cost meals compared with children and adolescents in families with incomes ≥185% of the FPL (75.9% versus 38.7%).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
High baseline rates of poor adolescent mental and behavioral health were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
What is added by this report?
By fall 2022, weekly ED visits among adolescents, and females in particular, for mental health conditions overall, suicide-related behaviors, and drug overdoses decreased compared with those during fall 2021; weekly ED visits among males were stable. Although sex differences were observed, as of fall 2022, weekly ED visits among females were at or higher than the prepandemic baseline for mental health conditions overall, suicide-related behaviors, and drug overdoses.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Early condition identification and trauma-informed interventions, coupled with evidence-based, comprehensive prevention efforts, are needed to support adolescents’ mental and behavioral health.

The U.S. adolescent mental and behavioral health crisis is ongoing,* with high pre–COVID-19 pandemic baseline rates† (1) and further increases in poor mental health (2), suicide-related behaviors (3), and drug overdose deaths (4) reported during 2020–2021. CDC examined changes in U.S. emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions (MHCs) overall and for nine specific MHCs,§ suicide-related behaviors (including suspected suicide attempts), and drug-involved overdoses (including opioids) among children and adolescents aged 12–17 years (adolescents) during January 2019–February 2023, overall and by sex. Compared with fall 2021, by fall 2022, decreases in weekly ED visits were reported among all adolescents, and females specifically, for MHCs overall, suicide-related behaviors, and drug overdoses; weekly ED visits among males were stable. During this same period, increases in weekly ED visits for opioid-involved overdoses were detected. Mean weekly ED visits in fall 2022 for suicide-related behaviors and MHCs overall were at or lower than the 2019 prepandemic baseline, respectively, and drug overdose visits were higher. Differences by sex were observed; levels among females were at or higher than prepandemic baselines for these conditions. These findings suggest some improvements as of fall 2022 in the trajectory of adolescent mental and behavioral health, as measured by ED visits; however, poor mental and behavioral health remains a substantial public health problem, particularly among adolescent females. Early identification and trauma-informed interventions, coupled with expanded evidence-based, comprehensive prevention efforts, are needed to support adolescents’ mental and behavioral health.
CDC examined ED visit data for adolescents from facilities consistently reporting data to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) during January 2019–early February 2023. A collaboration among CDC, local, and state health departments, and federal, academic, and private sector partners, NSSP receives anonymized medical record data from approximately 75% of EDs nationwide, although fewer than 50% of facilities from California, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Oklahoma currently participate. To reduce artifactual impact from changes in reporting patterns, analyses were restricted to facilities with a coefficient of variation for ED visits of ≤40 and average weekly informative discharge diagnosis ≥75% complete throughout the study period. In addition to displaying continuous trends, school semester surveillance periods in 2022 (spring included calendar weeks 1–23; summer, weeks 24–36; and fall, weeks 37–53) were compared with corresponding periods in 2021 and 2019 to monitor recent changes in ED visits and differences from the prepandemic baseline, respectively. School semester surveillance periods were used after visual inspection of visits related to MHCs, suicide-related behaviors, and drug overdoses for adolescents, which indicated substantial seasonal variation in visit patterns that mirrored U.S. K–12 education semesters (spring semester, summer vacation, fall semester). ED visits of interest were identified using a combination of free-text reason-for-visit (chief complaint), and administrative diagnosis codes (determined using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification; International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, Clinical Modification; and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov./view/cdc/127852), and did not differentiate by the primary or secondary diagnosis when multiple medical conditions were present as part of the visit record. CDC calculated percent change in mean weekly ED visits overall and by sex.¶ Changes were classified as decreased (≤−10%), stable (>−10% to <10%) or increased (≥10%) to support meaningful change identification and reduce identification of changes resulting from normative national ED visit fluctuations. Visit ratios (VRs)** with 95% CIs were calculated to describe the proportion of ED visits of interest among all adolescent ED visits in the surveillance versus comparison periods. Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.2; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and policy.††
During January 2019–February 2023, adolescent ED visits for MHCs (overall and specific), suicide-related behaviors (including suspected suicide attempts), and drug overdoses (including opioid-involved overdoses) varied over time and by school semester (Figure) (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov./view/cdc/127853). Mean weekly ED visits for MHCs overall, suicide-related behaviors, and drug overdoses were stable during spring and summer 2022 compared with those during 2021 (Table 1). By fall 2022, mean weekly adolescent ED visits were decreasing for MHCs overall (−11%), suicide-related behaviors (−12%), and drug overdoses (−10%) compared with fall 2021; trends for females mirrored overall patterns, whereas visits among males were stable for each of these outcomes (−7% to 3%). With some exceptions,§§ visits for MHCs overall, suicide-related behaviors, and all drug overdoses accounted for a smaller proportion of ED visits during 2022 compared with 2021.
From school semesters in 2021 to those in 2022, variation in ED visits for specific MHCs, suspected suicide attempts, and opioid-involved overdoses overall and by sex were observed (Table 1). By fall 2022, compared with fall 2021, mean weekly ED visits for opioid-involved overdoses increased among both females (10%) and males (41%). Compared with the same periods, ED visits for specific MHCs and suspected suicide attempts among females generally mirrored trends in visits for overall MHCs and suicide-related behaviors. Among males, mean weekly ED visits were stable for MHCs overall (−6%) and suicide-related behaviors (−7%), but decreased for some specific MHCs (e.g., anxiety [−10%], depression [−12%], and many less common conditions) and suspected suicide attempts (−13%). Among all adolescent ED visits, those for specific MHCs and suspected suicide attempts accounted for a smaller proportion (VRs = 0.59–0.85 and 0.75, respectively), and opioid-involved overdoses for a larger proportion (VR = 1.16) during fall 2022 compared with fall 2021. With some exceptions, sex-stratified findings were generally similar to these overall trends.
Compared with those during 2019 school semesters, visits for MHCs overall, suicide-related behaviors, and drug overdoses during 2022 varied (Table 2). By fall 2022, compared with fall 2019, mean weekly ED visits were lower than the prepandemic baseline for MHCs overall (–13%) and comparable to baseline for suicide-related behaviors (7%); visits for drug overdoses were higher during fall 2022 (10%) than during fall 2019. Mean weekly ED visits among females were stable for MHCs overall (−8%) but increased for suicide-related behaviors (14%) and drug overdoses (16%) during fall 2022 compared with fall 2019. Among males, mean weekly ED visits in fall 2022 for MHCs overall were lower (−20%) than those during fall 2019, but were stable for suicide-related behaviors (−6%) and drug overdoses (−3%). Among all adolescent ED visits during fall 2022, those for MHCs overall accounted for a lower proportion (VR = 0.87), and those for suicide-related behaviors and drug overdoses for a higher proportion (VRs = 1.07 and 1.10, respectively) than during fall 2019. In fall 2022, VR findings by sex generally mirrored broader trends, especially for females; among males, the proportion of suicide-related behaviors was lower (VR = 0.94) and for drug overdose (VR = 0.97) was similar, compared with fall 2019.
Adolescent ED visits for specific MHCs, suspected suicide attempts, and opioid-involved overdoses, overall and by sex, varied by school semester in 2022 compared with 2019 (Table 2). As of fall 2022, ED visits for eating disorders increased overall (55%; VR = 1.55) and for both sexes, and tic disorders increased among females only (56%; VR = 1.57). ED visits for other specific MHCs were lower than or comparable with visits during fall 2019. Patterns for suspected suicide attempts and opioid-involved overdoses generally followed the broader directional trends for suicide-related behaviors and drug overdoses, respectively.

Discussion
These findings extend previous research that indicated worsening in some aspects of adolescent mental and behavioral health during the COVID-19 pandemic (2–5) and suggest some improvements in the trajectory of adolescent mental and behavioral health, as measured by ED visits. Declines in adolescent ED visits for overdoses overall from 2021 to 2022 are consistent with other available nonfatal¶¶ and provisional fatal overdose*** data, though comparable data beyond 2021 on mental health and suicidal behaviors are limited. Increases in opioid-involved overdoses warrant further investigation but might be related to the overall rarity of adolescent opioid-involved overdoses, such that even a 10% change actually represents a small absolute change in the number of overdoses. Still, any adolescent overdose is concerning, particularly as increased availability of highly potent and lethal counterfeit pills containing illicitly manufactured fentanyl among adolescents via social media platforms††† has heighted awareness recently about increasing overdose risk among younger populations. Despite some recent declines in ED visits for MHCs, suicide-related behaviors, and drug overdoses, poor adolescent mental and behavioral health remains a notable public health problem (1–6), particularly because ED visits for these conditions remain similar to or higher than already concerningly high prepandemic baselines among females into 2022.
Multiple reasons might account for these findings. Many adolescents have returned to prepandemic-like school and community environments, which might have improved social engagement, reduced isolation, and supported mental and behavioral health for some adolescents (6,7). Familial or other stressors might also have declined, resulting in fewer adverse childhood experiences,§§§ which are strongly associated with adolescent mental and behavioral health (8). CDC has released resources to guide states, communities, and schools in selecting strategies for prevention of suicide,¶¶¶ overdose,**** and adverse childhood experiences,†††† based on the best available evidence. Implementation of these strategies and approaches, and others that support adolescents and their families§§§§ might improve mental and behavioral health for some adolescents. For example, communication campaigns¶¶¶¶ can improve the rapid identification of behavioral changes, improve adolescent help-seeking behaviors, and support early intervention by parents and trusted adults. Further, federal investments, such as the 988 suicide crisis line***** and improvements to accessible behavioral health care (e.g., telehealth)††††† might have improved families’ ability to identify support before a crisis or get care outside EDs.
Clinicians who work with adolescents being treated in EDs for opioid overdose might consider screening for opioid use disorder and providing timely, FDA-approved medications (9); clinicians might also consider screening for depression and anxiety when evaluating adolescents.§§§§§ Continued promotion of policies and programs that improve access to mental and behavioral health services, coupled with primary prevention efforts that support adolescents and their families, might mitigate risk for mental and behavioral health problems before they begin (10). Further prevention, intervention, and response efforts can be implemented to continue improving adolescent mental and behavioral health.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, NSSP data are not nationally representative and data quality variations across facilities could potentially lead to over- or underreporting, potentially affecting visit trends. Second, this analysis used percent change thresholds to support identification of meaningful changes; however, this might under-identify (in the case of common ED visits such as overall MHCs) or over-identify (in the case of rare ED visits such as opioid-involved overdose) concerning trends, because this metric depends upon number of visits for conditions of interest. Third, these data cannot be used to make causal inferences regarding trend changes. Fourth, this analysis could not differentiate between primary or secondary diagnoses when multiple conditions were addressed at the visit. Finally, data are from ED visits which do not represent the full spectrum of adolescent mental and behavioral health challenges; trends warrant confirmation with adolescent self-report data.
Prioritizing implementation of evidence-based prevention and trauma-informed early intervention and treatment strategies that promote mental and behavioral health among adolescents might help prevent MHCs, suicide-related behaviors, and drug overdoses, and improve overall health. CDC supports efforts to promote adolescent well-being and provides resources for clinicians,¶¶¶¶¶ families,****** schools,†††††† and communities.§§§§§§

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Salmonella Thompson is a relatively uncommon serotype not typically associated with seafood. Previous outbreaks have been associated with beef, chicken, and vine-stalk and leafy vegetables.
What is added by this report?
During May–October 2021, 115 persons in 15 states became ill with S. Thompson. Most patients reported seafood consumption in Colorado before illness onset. The outbreak strain was identified at a single seafood distributor and processor in Denver, where opportunities for cross-contamination, due to inadequate sanitization, were identified.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Cleaning practices at processing facilities must prevent cross-contamination. Multiagency collaboration to provide food safety information during product recalls is essential to ensure disposal of all recalled products.

In July 2021, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) laboratory identified a cluster of five Salmonella enterica serotype Thompson isolates related to one another within one allele difference, using whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST). These five isolates, submitted to the public health laboratory as is routine process for confirmatory testing of Salmonella, were highly related to those identified in a 2020 multistate investigation, during which traceback was conducted for sushi-grade tuna and salmon; a common supplier was not identified. The 2021 investigation commenced on August 5, 2021, with five patients living in Colorado, and one each in Missouri, Washington, and Wisconsin. During August–December 2021, CDC, CDPHE, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted epidemiologic, environmental, and laboratory investigations of this multistate outbreak of Salmonella Thompson. Isolates were genetically related to one another and to 2020 isolates within zero to one allele difference. Implicated seafood products were traced to a single seafood distributor, in which the outbreak strain was identified through environmental sampling, and in which inspection identified inadequate sanitization and opportunities for cross-contamination of raw fish. The distributor issued a voluntary recall of 16 seafood items with high potential for contamination and completed remediation actions. This outbreak illustrated the importance of effective cleaning and sanitizing procedures and implementation of controls. When multiple products are recalled during an outbreak investigation, collaboration between public health agencies and implicated facilities can help provide food safety information to restaurants, retailers, and consumers, and to ensure disposal of all recalled products.

Epidemiologic Investigation
A case was defined as an infection with a S. Thompson isolate within three allele differences of the outbreak strain by wgMLST, and with illness onset during May 11–October 16, 2021. Local or state health departments first contacted patients to attempt a routine interview to collect information on exposures during the week preceding illness onset, symptoms, and outcomes; seafood consumption was commonly reported. Consequently, a seafood-focused supplementary questionnaire was deployed on August 13, 2021, to reinterview patients. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*
A total of 115 outbreak-related cases were reported from 15 states (Figure 1). Among these, 93 (81%) patients were Colorado residents and 22 (19%) lived in 14 additional states (Figure 2). All but eight patients reported travel to Colorado during their exposure period (the 7 days before illness onset). All 2021 calendar-year isolates were within zero to two allele differences by wgMLST, and were zero to one allele difference from the 2020 S. Thompson outbreak isolates. The median age of patients in the 2021 outbreak was 29 years (range = <1–85 years); 61 (53%) were female. Among 111 patients with information available, illness onset occurred during May 11–October 16. Twenty (26%) patients were hospitalized; no deaths were reported. Among 90 patients with exposure information, 76 (84%) reported eating any seafood, and 35 of 85 (41%) reported consuming sushi or raw fish. Both proportions were significantly higher than the proportion of respondents from the FoodNet Population Survey that reported eating any seafood (35%) or sushi or raw fish (8%) during the week before participating in the survey (1). FoodNet Population Survey data provide estimates on how often persons in the surveillance area are typically expected to be exposed to a specific food vehicle; deviations from the expected estimate might indicate that a food vehicle should be considered suspect.

Environmental Health Investigation
CDPHE and FDA completed concurrent traceback and traceforward investigations. Traceback investigation involved requesting invoices from all restaurants where patients reported having dined during their exposure period. Records related to tuna, shrimp, salmon, and halibut were reviewed to ascertain common distribution sources. In addition, investigators identified six subclusters, defined as establishments where two or more patients from separate households reported consuming a variety of seafood items during their exposure period. Detailed build sheets (comprehensive instructional documents for food preparation, storage, and plating) from the six subclusters were collected. Five subcluster establishments were restaurants, including one sushi bar located within a grocery store. Traceback identified a common seafood distributor and processor that directly supplied four of the six subcluster establishments.
CDPHE’s Division of Environmental Health Services (DEHS) conducted a traceforward investigation. DEHS collected customer lists and five samples of three unique products from the implicated seafood distributor and processor facility. The outbreak strain was not identified in these five samples.
On September 22, 2021, FDA performed a seafood Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point inspection† with environmental sampling at the implicated distributor and processor facility. The outbreak strain was identified in 13 (9.8%) of 132 environmental swabs of the facility’s floor and floor drains. The inspection also identified several opportunities for cross-contamination of raw fish, including the use of high pressure hoses that produced backsplash onto fresh product. Other substantial findings included insufficient sanitizer concentration, condensation dripping onto product contact surfaces, and using gloved hands to remove water from floor drains without changing gloves after contact with the drains (2).
Top
Laboratory Investigation
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the 21 Colorado isolates from 2020 and 97 of the 2021 isolates at the CDPHE laboratory following the PulseNet or Illumina MiSeq paired-end WGS standard operating procedure (3). Assembly and analysis of these isolates was performed using BioNumerics, a software application for managing microbiologic data, following PulseNet guidelines.§ Results were submitted to the PulseNet National Database, which was then queried to pull WGS data for all outbreak-associated samples and environmental samples collected by FDA (4). wgMLST was performed on each genome using BioNumerics to generate a similarity matrix (a matrix of the number of allele differences for all possible pairwise comparisons). A clustering analysis was conducted on the matrix using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean algorithm, a method for constructing dendrograms in a stepwise manner, based on order of similarity (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127756).
Overall, WGS results supported the epidemiologic data, indicating a common source of infection for the 2020 and 2021 outbreaks, confirmed in 2021 to be a common seafood distributor and processor. Based on genetic similarity, the largest grouping of outbreak-associated isolates contained 100 samples, including clinical isolates from 2020 and 2021, and nine environmental isolates from 2021, all with zero allele difference. Among 112 clinical isolates, WGS analysis results indicated no concerning antibiotic resistance, signifying no impact on provider treatment recommendations.
Top
Public Health Response
On October 8, 2021, the seafood distributor and processor issued a voluntary recall of 16 raw, fresh seafood products processed onsite (5). Potential cross-contamination within the processing environment resulted in the large number of recalled products and compounded the challenge of identifying a specific food vehicle during the investigation. A call with the facility occurred on October 7 to discuss the WGS results, recall, and corrective actions. On October 8, the facility temporarily ceased operations to carry out corrective actions, which included reassessing cleaning and sanitizing procedures and intensifying cleaning and sanitizing of the facility and equipment, eliminating the use of high-pressure hoses, hiring a food safety consultant to assist with the facility’s root cause analysis, and revising the environmental monitoring program . On October 8, FDA (6), CDC (7), and CDPHE (8) all issued web posts alerting the public to this outbreak and identifying the facility. FDA carried out additional traceback actions using information collected from the facility regarding suppliers. Multiple upstream domestic and foreign seafood suppliers were identified, but evidence was not available to identify a single contamination source.
CDC, FDA, and CDPHE advised consumers, restaurants, and retailers not to eat, sell, or serve any recalled seafood that was sold in three Colorado grocery stores and several restaurants. Public messaging advised consumers to discard any recalled products they might have purchased fresh and subsequently frozen.

Discussion
The outbreak investigation resulted in a large amount of interview, traceback, and traceforward data, compounding the challenge of identifying a specific food vehicle or source, and limiting the findings. For example, many patients reported eating seafood items at a variety of locations during their exposure periods. Subcluster analysis allowed investigators to focus this information and prioritize data collection from facilities commonly reported by patients. However, the small size and complex nature of each subcluster limited the power of this analysis. The largest subcluster contained only four confirmed outbreak patients, and three subclusters included only two patients each. In one instance, a single patient reported consuming food at more than one subcluster facility, which further complicated the analysis. Reinterviewing patients and asking about dining history at commonly reported restaurants might be beneficial to expanding the size of subclusters and power of data collected. Throughout the investigation, competing priorities limited the capacity of public health agencies, leading to delays in collection of invoices, build sheets, and customer lists. Traceforward actions allowed investigators to supplement supplier information collected by local public health and regulatory agencies with customer lists provided by distributors to identify common distribution patterns among reported facilities. In addition, investigators faced resistance from restaurant facilities concerned about sharing proprietary information on dishes or supplier invoices.
This investigation illustrates the importance of clear and direct communication to the public and partnerships with local public health and regulatory officials who can leverage existing relationships with local facilities. When an outbreak investigation results in the recall of multiple products, collaboration between public health agencies and implicated facilities can serve to provide food safety information to restaurants, retailers, and consumers, and to ensure disposal of all recalled products. Implementing appropriate cleaning practices at processing facilities that are focused on prevention of cross-contamination is important.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Endemic transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) continues only in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
What is added by this report?
In 2022, Malawi and Mozambique reported WPV1 cases linked to a Pakistan strain, the first WPV1 cases in the African region since 2016. During 2022 and 2023, Afghanistan and Pakistan reported WPV1 cases. Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses were detected in areas of the world where poliovirus had been eliminated. Cocirculation of more than one poliovirus type occurred in multiple countries.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The detections of poliovirus in areas where it had been previously eliminated underscore the threat of continued poliovirus spread to any area where the population is insufficiently vaccinated against poliovirus.

Table 1
Table 2
Since the World Health Assembly established the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988, two of the three wild poliovirus (WPV) serotypes (types 2 and 3) have been eradicated, and global WPV cases have decreased by more than 99.9%. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where indigenous WPV type 1 (WPV1) transmission has not been interrupted. This report summarizes progress toward global polio eradication during January 1, 2021–March 31, 2023, and updates previous reports (1,2). In 2022, Afghanistan and Pakistan reported 22 WPV1 cases, compared with five in 2021; as of May 5, 2023, a single WPV1 case was reported in Pakistan in 2023. A WPV1 case was reported on the African continent for the first time since 2016, when officials in Malawi confirmed a WPV1 case in a child with paralysis onset in November 2021; neighboring Mozambique subsequently reported eight genetically linked cases. Outbreaks of polio caused by circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) can occur when oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) strains circulate for a prolonged time in underimmunized populations, allowing reversion to neurovirulence (3). A total of 859 cVDPV cases occurred during 2022, an increase of 23% from 698 cases in 2021. cVDPVs were detected in areas where poliovirus transmission had long been eliminated (including in Canada, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States). In addition, cocirculation of multiple poliovirus types occurred in multiple countries globally (including Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], Israel, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of the Congo, and Yemen). The 2022–2026 GPEI strategic plan targeted the goal of detecting the last cases of WPV1 and cVDPV in 2023 (4). The current global epidemiology of poliovirus transmission makes the likelihood of meeting this target date unlikely. The detections of poliovirus (WPV1 and cVDPVs) in areas where it had been previously eliminated underscore the threat of continued poliovirus spread to any area where there is insufficient vaccination to poliovirus (3). Mass vaccination and surveillance should be further enhanced in areas of transmission to interrupt poliovirus transmission and to end the global threat of paralytic polio in children.

Poliovirus Vaccination
In April 2016, trivalent OPV (tOPV), consisting of Sabin strain types 1, 2, and 3, was withdrawn from routine immunization programs and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)* worldwide and replaced with bivalent OPV (bOPV, containing Sabin-strain types 1 and 3). Routine immunization programs worldwide provide either 3 doses of bOPV and 1–2 doses of injectable inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or IPV alone. Seroconversion after IPV vaccination protects against disease caused by all three polio serotypes but does not protect against poliovirus transmission. Because of cocirculation of cVDPV2 and other poliovirus serotypes, GPEI authorized administration of tOPV during SIAs in Afghanistan and Pakistan during 2017–2020, in Yemen during 2021–2022, and in areas of Somalia during 2022–2023. In response to cVDPV2 outbreaks, monovalent OPV Sabin type 2 (mOPV2) is approved for outbreak response use in SIAs and has been used most recently in Somalia. Because of the risks for reversion to neurovirulence associated with Sabin-strain OPV2 in areas with low immunity, the World Health Organization (WHO) granted emergency use listing of novel OPV2 (nOPV2) in November 2020 (5); nOPV2 is more genetically stable than the Sabin strain (6) and has been used in SIAs since March 2021. Challenges of nOPV2 supply during the time of this report have resulted in delayed SIAs in response to cVDPV2 outbreaks (3).
In 2021, the estimated global coverage with ≥3 doses of IPV or OPV (Pol3) among infants by age 1 year during routine immunization was 80%†; estimated coverage with 1 full dose or 2 fractional doses§ of IPV (IPV1) in OPV-using countries was 79%. Global coverage with Pol3 and IPV1 declined from 2019 values of 85% and 83%, respectively, when the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted health services. In Afghanistan, 2021 national Pol3 coverage was 71% and IPV1 coverage was 67%. Pakistan’s 2021 national coverage estimates were 83% for both Pol3 and IPV1. In Malawi, 2021 Pol3 and IPV1 coverage was 89% and 92%, respectively, and in Mozambique, 2021 coverage estimates for Pol3 and IPV1 were 67% and 70%, respectively (7). Immunization coverage estimates in subnational levels of these countries are often substantially lower.
During January 1, 2021–March 31, 2023, GPEI supported 48 countries in implementing 219 SIAs, during which approximately 988 million bOPV, 616,000 IPV, 960,000 fractional IPV, 90 million mOPV2, 595 million nOPV2, and 100 million tOPV doses were administered. In 2022, lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS)¶ surveys after SIAs indicated performance gaps in high-risk districts in Afghanistan, Malawi, Mozambique, and Pakistan (8–10).

Poliovirus Surveillance
Poliovirus transmission is primarily detected through case-based syndromic surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in persons aged <15 years, with confirmation of poliovirus by testing stool specimens at one of the 144 WHO-accredited laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network in 91 countries (Table 1). In 2022, AFP surveillance reviews in 34 countries at high risk for poliovirus spread indicated that 26 (76%) countries met targets for the two primary surveillance indicators at the national level.** Because of the high proportion of asymptomatic infections, environmental surveillance (ES), the systematic sampling and testing of sewage for poliovirus, can supplement AFP surveillance to detect poliovirus transmission and improve overall surveillance sensitivity. The total number of ES samples collected in countries with poliovirus transmission increased from 8,945 samples from 36 countries in 2021 to 12,259 samples from 40 countries in 2022 (Table 2).
Top
Reported Polio Cases and Isolations
Countries reporting WPV cases and isolations. In 2022, the two remaining countries with endemic WPV1 transmission, Afghanistan and Pakistan, reported two and 20 WPV1 cases, respectively (Figure) (Table 1). In Afghanistan, two cases were reported from two provinces, representing a 50% decrease from the four cases reported from two provinces in 2021 (8). The 20 cases reported in Pakistan in 2022 were all from security-compromised districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, representing a nineteenfold increase over the single case reported in 2021 (9). As of May 5, a single case of WPV1 was reported in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan in 2023. The paralysis onset dates of the latest reported WPV1 case in Afghanistan was August 29, 2022, and in Pakistan was February 20, 2023.
In Afghanistan, among 702 sewage samples collected in 2022, 22 (3%) yielded a WPV1 isolate, representing a 14-fold increase in the percentage of isolates from 0.2% (one WPV1 isolate detected in 473 samples) collected during 2021 (Table 2). In Pakistan, among 1,220 sewage samples collected during 2022, 37 (3%) WPV1-positive isolates were detected, a 57% decrease in the percentage of isolates from 7% (65 WPV1 isolates from 887 samples) in 2021. As of May 5, 2023, the latest WPV1 detections by ES were from samples taken on April 3, 2023, in Afghanistan and on February 21, 2023, in Pakistan.
In 2021, a single paralytic WPV1 case in Malawi was genetically linked to virus circulating in Pakistan and was confirmed in February 2022. In 2022, eight WPV1 cases were detected in Mozambique, genetically linked to the Malawi case, with the latest date of paralysis in August 2022 (10).
Countries reporting cVDPV cases and isolations. During January 2021–March 2023, a total of 1,619 cVDPV cases were reported from 36 countries. Six countries reported 225 cVDPV1 cases, 34 countries reported 1,393 cVDPV2 cases, and one country (Israel) reported one cVDPV3 case. DRC, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of the Congo, and Yemen reported co-circulation of cVDPV1 and cVDPV2, and Israel reported co-circulation of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3. Global cVDPV2 cases decreased by 1.3% in 2022 (673 cases in 20 countries) compared with 2021 (682 cases in 22 countries); the 504 cVDPV cases detected in DRC represent 59% of all globally reported cVDPV cases in 2022. No cVDPV2 cases or ES detections in Afghanistan or Pakistan were reported after July 2021 (7,8). Global cVDPV1 cases increased by 1,056% (185 cases in five countries) in 2022 compared with 16 cases in two countries in 2021.

The 2022 increase in WPV1 cases in Pakistan’s security-challenged subdistricts of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the ongoing circulation in contiguous districts of eastern Afghanistan form a narrow geographic band of indigenous WPV1 transmission. One major, ongoing challenge to reaching children with OPV in these reservoir districts is the substantial movement of a subpopulation at high risk between Afghanistan and Pakistan. In Afghanistan, an intensive schedule of SIAs conducted by local authorities during November 2021–September 2022 reached many previously inaccessible, unvaccinated children (8). However, 188,447 children residing in Afghanistan’s South Region could not be vaccinated during November 2021–September 2022 because of a regional ban on community polio SIAs. In early 2023, authorities in Afghanistan banned women from working outside the home; the ban has not substantially affected the polio program to date. In Pakistan, AFP surveillance gaps and insufficient SIA implementation quality in the areas with security issues pose substantial challenges (9). The successful interruption of cVDPV2 transmission in both countries in 2021 following outbreak response SIAs with tOPV and mOPV2 offers optimism that WPV1 transmission can be stopped in the near future. In 2022, both countries resumed cross-border coordination and synchronization of campaigns; intensifying and strengthening these efforts could help to mitigate cross-border WPV1 spread.
The WHO African Region detected its first WPV1 case in >5 years in 2021 in Malawi, with subsequent limited spread in Mozambique. Genomic sequence analyses for both the isolated WPV1 and cVDPV1, which cocirculated in both countries, highlight critical surveillance gaps in the region (10). Delays in specimen transport time, as well as some ineffective ES systems and increases in sample processing time have delayed polio detection and the subsequent response. In Mozambique, suboptimal SIA performance and decreased Pol3 coverage leave children vulnerable to further WPV1 and cVDPV transmission. Simultaneous health emergencies resulting from cholera and measles outbreaks, as well as cyclone response, in both countries have challenged the poliovirus outbreak responses. Improved SIA quality is needed to reach chronically missed children, and more sensitive surveillance will be essential in confirming the interruption of poliovirus transmission.
The 2022–2026 GPEI Strategic Plan (4) named the end of 2023 as the target for the last detection of both WPV1 and cVDPV2. ES detections of WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan and AFP detection in Pakistan in early 2023 clearly jeopardize achieving the WPV1 target. Similarly, with extensive transmission of cVDPV1 and cVDPV2 in 2023, the cVDPV detection goal is unlikely to be met by the target date. In addition, as of May 5, 2023, emergences of cVDPV2 linked to nOPV2 use had been detected in AFP cases in African countries.†† Although this finding was expected even with a vaccine with increased genetic stability, considering the number of doses administered, the finding indicates the need to implement high-quality response SIAs to raise immunity in all children, independent of the vaccine type used. The major hurdles to reaching the cVDPV2 GPEI goals in the near future are remaining gaps in surveillance, suboptimal SIA quality in many areas, and a highly limited nOPV2 vaccine supply, resulting in delayed campaigns for a number of countries (5).
The detection of cVDPV transmission in regions where poliovirus transmission has long been eliminated (e.g., genetically linked cVDPV2 in Canada, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States) together with the importation of WPV1 genetically related to a Pakistan strain into southeastern Africa underscore the threat of continued global poliovirus spread to any area, given global migration and travel (3). Further, this risk is growing because of increased postpandemic vaccine hesitancy and pandemic disruptions in immunization services, with decreased Pol3 coverage globally. Progress toward polio eradication requires continued international commitment to strengthening routine immunization, enhancing global surveillance activities, increasing SIA quality, and implementing preventive bOPV SIAs with or without IPV in areas with chronically low routine immunization coverage.

* SIAs are mass immunization campaigns intended to stop poliovirus circulation by immunizing every child aged <5 years with 2 OPV doses, irrespective of previous immunization status.
† 2021 is the most recent year for which data are available.
§ https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases/poliomyelitis-(polio)
¶ LQAS is a rapid survey method used to evaluate the quality of vaccination coverage after SIAs in predefined areas, such as health districts (“lots”). In each lot, six clusters are selected according to probability proportional to size, then 10 houses with eligible children are randomly selected within each cluster, and vaccination status is tallied. If the number of unvaccinated children in the sample is four or more, the SIA quality is interpreted to be of lower quality and mop-up activities are recommended. Conversely, if fewer than four selected children are unvaccinated, the SIA is considered to be of high quality.

Authorizations to collect certain public health data expire at the end of the U.S. public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023.
What is added by this report?
Changes to the national COVID-19 monitoring strategy and COVID Data Tracker capitalize on marked improvements in multiple surveillance systems. Weekly COVID-19 hospital admission levels and the percentage of all COVID-19–associated deaths will be primary surveillance indicators. Emergency department visits and percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results will help detect early changes in trends. Genomic surveillance will continue to help identify and monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants.
What are the implications for public health practice?
COVID-19 is an ongoing public health problem that will be monitored with sustainable data sources to guide prevention efforts.

Table 2
On January 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared, under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, a U.S. public health emergency because of the emergence of a novel virus, SARS-CoV-2.* After 13 renewals, the public health emergency will expire on May 11, 2023. Authorizations to collect certain public health data will expire on that date as well. Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies remains a public health priority, and a number of surveillance indicators have been identified to facilitate ongoing monitoring. After expiration of the public health emergency, COVID-19–associated hospital admission levels will be the primary indicator of COVID-19 trends to help guide community and personal decisions related to risk and prevention behaviors; the percentage of COVID-19–associated deaths among all reported deaths, based on provisional death certificate data, will be the primary indicator used to monitor COVID-19 mortality. Emergency department (ED) visits with a COVID-19 diagnosis and the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, derived from an established sentinel network, will help detect early changes in trends. National genomic surveillance will continue to be used to estimate SARS-CoV-2 variant proportions; wastewater surveillance and traveler-based genomic surveillance will also continue to be used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants. Disease severity and hospitalization-related outcomes are monitored via sentinel surveillance and large health care databases. Monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness (VE), and vaccine safety will also continue. Integrated strategies for surveillance of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses can further guide prevention efforts. COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths are largely preventable through receipt of updated vaccines and timely administration of therapeutics (1–4).
Although COVID-19 no longer poses the societal emergency that it did when it first emerged in late 2019, COVID-19 remains an ongoing public health challenge. By April 26, 2023, more than 104 million U.S. COVID-19 cases, 6 million related hospitalizations, and 1.1 million COVID-19–associated deaths were reported to CDC and summarized on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker.† COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death during 2020 and 2021§ and the fourth leading cause during 2022 (5). To mitigate the consequences of the pandemic, approximately 675 million COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered, including 55 million updated (bivalent) booster doses. Based on seroprevalence data, infection- and vaccine-induced population immunity in the United States was 95% by December 2021 (6). As a result, rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths have declined substantially since March 2022 (7). This report describes changes to the national COVID-19 surveillance strategy, data sources, and indicators that will be made after the public health emergency declaration expires; these indicators will be displayed as weekly or otherwise scheduled updates to CDC’s COVID Data Tracker.

Continued Surveillance After May 11, 2023
Most COVID-19 surveillance data sources will continue to be available after the public health emergency declaration ends on May 11; the reporting cadence of some will change, and three will be discontinued (Table 1). Since December 15, 2022, daily reporting to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) of aggregate counts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to acute care and critical access U.S. hospitals has been required. After the public health emergency ends on May 11, 2023, a switch to a weekly cadence of national reporting will affect data processing and introduce reporting lag. NHSN data on COVID-19 hospital admissions per 100,000 population will be the primary surveillance indicator to help guide community and individual decisions related to risk and prevention behaviors. These data have similar suitability for tracking local COVID-19 activity as do COVID-19 Community Levels (CCLs) (8) and will be updated weekly on COVID Data Tracker at the county,¶ state, regional, and national levels.
Considerable gains in the timeliness of National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) death certificate data processing were accomplished during the pandemic (9). Provisional death certificate data from NVSS, including decedents for whom COVID-19 is listed as an underlying or a contributing cause of death, will be the primary data source for monitoring COVID-19 mortality. Among several mortality-based metrics, the percentage of COVID-19–associated deaths among all reported deaths in NVSS will be a new weekly surveillance indicator on COVID Data Tracker that is comparable with a corresponding influenza mortality surveillance indicator (Table 2).** Because the lag in mortality reporting is similar for COVID-19 deaths and deaths overall, this indicator is not biased by incomplete reporting in previous weeks and allows for timely tracking of mortality trends (8).
The National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) has expanded substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, with data from 6,300 facilities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. NSSP includes 75% of all U.S. ED visits (Table 1); coverage is currently limited in Minnesota and Oklahoma, and discharge diagnosis completeness is currently limited in Missouri. Using NSSP discharge diagnosis data, the weekly percentage of patients who receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 among all ED visits is an indicator that can identify trends earlier than hospital admission rates can (8).
Monitoring national and regional trends in the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results will be based on surveillance data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). This system is an established sentinel network of approximately 450 clinical, public health, and commercial laboratories that voluntarily submit weekly data on numbers of positive test results and total tests performed. As another early indicator, the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results from NREVSS is a suitable alternative to that obtained through COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting (CELR), which will not be possible after May 11, because reporting of negative rest results will not be required (8). Because SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes and the geographic representation of NREVSS laboratories are heterogeneous (with one to 31 participating laboratories per state), region-level rather than state-level data will be displayed.
Genomic surveillance to estimate SARS-CoV-2 variant proportions at the national and regional levels will continue with a biweekly cadence and revised analytic methods for weighting based on the probability of selecting positive laboratory specimens for sequencing (10). As fewer specimens and sequences become available, a system that is scaled sufficiently to allow for regional estimates will be established in collaboration with the network of public health laboratories that have participated in the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance program.†† The National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) and Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance (TGS) Program are additional sources of surveillance data for monitoring early trends in SARS-CoV-2 infections and variant proportions (NWSS) and for early detection of new variants in travelers entering the United States (TGS) that will continue to be available with daily or weekly updates.§§
In addition to NHSN, sentinel surveillance and large health care databases will continue to monitor disease severity and hospitalization-related outcomes. The Coronavirus Disease 2019–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET)¶¶ uses active, population-based surveillance to estimate rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated hospital admissions and also collects detailed clinical information, including underlying conditions, to better understand trends and risk for severe disease. COVID-NET currently comprises 98 counties in 13 states. In addition, three large databases of electronic health care records (BD Insights Research Database [BD], the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network [PCORnet], and Premier Healthcare Database’s Special COVID-19 Release [Premier])*** will support monitoring of COVID-19 severity among hospitalized patients (i.e., percentages of patients in intensive care units [ICUs], those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, and deaths).
Monitoring vaccination coverage, safety,††† and VE are ongoing priorities because COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths can be prevented through receipt of updated COVID-19 vaccines (1–3). Data use agreements established at the start of the pandemic with states, territories, and selected cities to facilitate receipt of comprehensive vaccine administration data from immunization information systems will terminate at the end of the public health emergency declaration. However, most jurisdictions have signed data use agreement extensions and will continue to submit COVID-19 vaccination data. Although future data might not be as complete because reporting requirements vary by state, the National Immunization Survey Child and Adult COVID Modules will continue to provide data on COVID-19 vaccination coverage and intent at the national and state levels via COVID Data Tracker and COVIDVaxView.§§§ VE platforms will continue to provide robust assessment of the real-world performance of vaccines (e.g., Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill [IVY] and VISION Networks) (1,2). However, strategies for evaluating VE will need to incorporate alternative sources of vaccination data (e.g., patient/provider interviews or claims data) if immunization information systems are not sufficiently complete.
To continue facilitating access to national COVID-19 surveillance data, a first-phase, redesigned COVID Data Tracker website will launch on May 11, 2023. These data will continue providing an evidence base of information to guide prioritization of public health action. Numerous surveillance data sources and corresponding metrics and geographic levels will be updated weekly on COVID Data Tracker, with visualizations of trends and maps (Table 2). County-level hospitalization data will continue to include metrics on COVID-19–associated admissions and inpatient and ICU bed occupancy. Metrics for COVID-19–associated deaths (state-level), ED visits for COVID-19 (state-level), and percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (HHS region-level) will also be displayed. Metric levels will be anchored to levels of hospital admission rates used in the CCLs (8). The COVID Data Tracker will also continue to display SARS-CoV-2 variant proportion estimates and wastewater and traveler-based genomic surveillance data, as well as vaccination data and health care data on disease severity. In addition, availability of priority data will continue after May 11, 2023, for health equity, pediatric and special populations (e.g., vaccination coverage among persons who are pregnant and those with disabilities), health care settings (e.g., nursing home residents), and seroprevalence. SARS-CoV-2 infections remain nationally notifiable, and line-level COVID-19 case surveillance data will continue to be available, including public use data at https://data.cdc.gov.

Data Collection That Will Be Discontinued After May 11, 2023
After the expiration of the public health emergency on May 11, 2023, authorizations to collect certain types of public health data expire (Table 1). The COVID Data Tracker includes a page for accessing archived data.¶¶¶ HHS can no longer require reporting of negative SARS-CoV-2 testing results via CELR reporting. This change removes the ability to monitor the national percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results using the CELR data source. CELR data served as a useful early indicator of SARS-COV-2 transmission during the pandemic. However, since a peak of approximately 17.4 million NAATs performed weekly in January 2022, coinciding with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant surge, the reported weekly volume of NAATs performed declined to less than 1 million by April 26, 2023. This decline is related in part to increased use of antigen tests as well as at-home testing.**** The CELR data have become more variable in quality or altogether unavailable in many jurisdictions over time. CDC’s COVID-19 Community Transmission Levels, which were derived, in part, from CELR data, also will be discontinued.
National reporting of aggregate weekly counts of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths, which CDC compiles using automated data extraction from jurisdictional websites and dashboards and direct submissions, will also be discontinued with the expiration of the public health emergency. This transition is consistent with many state and local health authorities’ decisions to discontinue public reporting of these data. Aggregate counts of COVID-19 cases have been useful for monitoring changing trends in incidence but have become less representative of actual rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections or levels of transmission over time, related to decreased laboratory testing, increased home testing, changes in reporting practices, and asymptomatic infections. Early in the pandemic, aggregate reporting from health departments provided more up-to-date counts of total deaths than did NVSS, but the timeliness of NVSS is now comparable with that of the aggregate counts (8,9). As part of the shift from reporting of aggregate death count data to use of NVSS data, date of death will be used rather than report date.
CCLs are based on a composite metric that includes COVID-19 hospital admission rates, inpatient bed utilization among patients with COVID-19, and case rates derived from aggregate reporting of case counts by jurisdictions. Because aggregate weekly case counts will end, CCLs also will end on May 11, 2023. Hospital admissions levels from NHSN closely align with CCLs (8) and will replace the CCL metric. Monthly reporting of case, hospitalization, and mortality rates by vaccination status will end with the expiration of the public health emergency.

Discussion
Beginning in 2020, the historic response to the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid improvements in processing, reporting, and visualizing of timely and granular public health surveillance data on an unprecedented scale. In 2023, as part of the transition of COVID-19 from emergency to routine public health program activities, CDC has established the Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division,†††† which is committed to working with state, tribal, local, territorial, federal, and other partners on the prevention of COVID-19 within a sustainable and integrated surveillance strategy that monitors other circulating respiratory viruses and prevention measures, including vaccination, to provide timely and comprehensive situational awareness. In the past year, CDC has developed several public dashboards displaying data on hospitalizations or ED visits for diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus.§§§§
Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies continues to be a public health priority during the transition from the emergency phase of the COVID-19 response to routine public health practice. Approximately 1,000 COVID-19–associated weekly deaths were reported in early April 2023; COVID-19–associated deaths are largely preventable through receipt of updated COVID-19 vaccine and timely administration of therapeutics¶¶¶¶ (1–4).

¶ County-level hospital data, including new hospital admissions levels, are derived using calculations performed at the Health Service Area (HSA) level. An HSA is defined by CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics as a geographic area containing at least one county that is self-contained with respect to the population’s provision of routine hospital care. Every county in the United States is assigned to an HSA, and each HSA must contain at least one hospital. Data presented represent admissions and bed use among hospitals within the selected HSA.

§§ State, tribal, local, and territorial health departments participating in the NWSS submit testing data to CDC. CDC standardizes, interprets, and presents these data. How often sites collect wastewater samples and how frequently data are reported to CDC varies by health department. NWSS data for SARS-CoV-2 trends are updated daily, and data for SARS-CoV-2 variants are updated weekly (https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/index.html). The Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance Program tracks SARS-CoV-2 variants by collecting samples from international air travelers arriving from more than 30 countries at seven major U.S. airports. These samples are then sent to a laboratory network for PCR testing; all positive samples undergo genomic sequencing. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travel-genomic-surveillance

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
COVID-19 monitoring will remain a public health priority after the U.S. public health emergency declaration expires on May 11, 2023.
What is added by this report?
Assessment of available surveillance indicators found that COVID-19 hospital admission levels were concordant with COVID-19 Community Levels. COVID-19–associated hospital admission rates lagged 1 day behind case rates and 4 days behind percentages of COVID-19 emergency department visits and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. National Vital Statistics System trends in the percentage of COVID-19 deaths strongly correlated with, and were 13 days timelier, than aggregate death count data.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Rates of COVID-19–associated hospital admission and the percentages of positive test results, COVID-19 emergency department visits, and COVID-19 deaths are suitable and timely indicators of trends in COVID-19 activity and severity.

When the U.S. COVID-19 public health emergency declaration expires on May 11, 2023, national reporting of certain categories of COVID-19 public health surveillance data will be transitioned to other data sources or will be discontinued; COVID-19 hospitalization data will be the only data source available at the county level (1). In anticipation of the transition, national COVID-19 surveillance data sources and indicators were evaluated for purposes of ongoing monitoring. The timeliness and correlations among surveillance indicators were analyzed to assess the usefulness of COVID-19–associated hospital admission rates as a primary indicator for monitoring COVID-19 trends, as well as the suitability of other replacement data sources. During April 2022–March 2023, COVID-19 hospital admission rates from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)† lagged 1 day behind case rates and 4 days behind percentages of positive test results and COVID-19 emergency department (ED) visits from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In the same analysis, National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) trends in the percentage of deaths that were COVID-19–associated, which is tracked by date of death rather than by report date, were observable 13 days earlier than those from aggregate death count data, which will be discontinued (1). During October 2020–March 2023, strong correlations were observed between NVSS and aggregate death data (0.78) and between the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results from the National Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Surveillance System (NREVSS) and COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting (CELR) (0.79), which will also be discontinued (1). Weekly COVID-19 Community Levels (CCLs) will be replaced with levels of COVID-19 hospital admission rates (low, medium, or high) which demonstrated >99% concordance by county during February 2022–March 2023. COVID-19–associated hospital admission levels are a suitable primary metric for monitoring COVID-19 trends, the percentage of COVID-19 deaths is a timely disease severity indicator, and the percentages of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results from NREVSS and ED visits serve as early indicators for COVID-19 monitoring. Collectively, these surveillance data sources and indicators can support monitoring of the impact of COVID-19 and related prevention and control strategies as ongoing public health priorities.
Authorizations to collect certain categories of public health data will expire on May 11, 2023 (1), including national data on the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results from CELR (2); national reporting of aggregate case and death counts, which CDC compiles from official public health jurisdiction sources, will also be discontinued (3). CDC will transition to using provisional mortality data from NVSS as the primary data source on COVID-19 deaths (4) and to using SARS-CoV-2 test positivity data from NREVSS, an established sentinel network of more than 450 clinical, public health, and commercial laboratories (5). Finally, county COVID-19 hospital admission levels based on admission rates per 100,000 population will replace CCLs§ as a primary metric for COVID-19 monitoring. CCLs were first designed to assist communities and members of the public in making prevention decisions based on local context and unique needs (6).
Statistical measures were used to compare trends in moving 7-day averages for COVID-19 surveillance indicators during October 1, 2020–March 22, 2023, including cross-correlation, autocorrelation, pairwise correlations, and a geographic consistency metric at the state level. Daily averages were available for most data sources; weekly data were available for NVSS,¶ NREVSS, and aggregate case and death counts after a shift to weekly cadence in October 2022, with some jurisdictions continuing to report daily totals. Cross-correlation was used to estimate the lag (offset in days) in indicators relative to COVID-19–associated hospital admission rates** during April 1, 2022–March 22, 2023, by calculating Spearman’s correlation coefficients by state with reporting lags from −35 days to 35 days over a moving 12-week window; the lag that produced the highest mean correlation was selected. Lags were adjusted to obtain temporal alignment of indicators in subsequent analyses. Pairwise Spearman’s correlations were used to evaluate associations between indicators, and mean correlations were calculated and ranked. Spearman’s autocorrelations were used to assess the signal-to-noise ratio for each indicator (compared with itself, offset by 7 days). Geographic consistency was evaluated using a metric calculated by computing daily z-scores for each indicator, averaging these scores by U.S. state, and computing the standard deviation over all states. Surveillance indicators with lower values for the geographic consistency metric were less likely to have jurisdictions consistently reporting higher or lower than average indicator values.
A linear regression model†† was fit for each surveillance indicator during October 1, 2020–March 31, 2022, and April 1, 2022–March 22, 2023, to estimate ratios (slopes) relative to the COVID-19–associated hospital admission rates. To categorize indicators for data visualized on maps, the calculated ratios were used to identify thresholds for each indicator that were anchored to hospital admission rates used in the CCLs (10 and 20 admissions per 100,000 population), but the lower two categories were divided to increase resolution during periods of lower incidence (five, 10, 15, and 20 admissions per 100,000 population). Percent agreement for weekly CCLs and COVID-19 hospital admission levels (<10.0, 10.0–19.9, and ≥20.0 per 100,000 population) was calculated among the 3,220 U.S. counties (and county-equivalent areas) during February 24, 2022–March 23, 2023 (i.e., since the CCLs were launched). The analysis was carried out using Python (version 3.8.6; Python Software Foundation) with packages Pandas (version 1.5.2) and NumPy (version 1.21.6) for all correlations. Linear regression was carried out using scikit-learn (version 1.1.1). This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§
Normalized trends in surveillance indicators largely aligned over time; differences were observed in lag and proportionality relative to hospital admission rates for both early indicators of COVID-19 activity and disease severity indicators (Figure). Analysis of cross-correlations between surveillance indicators showed that trends in hospital admission rates lagged 1 day behind case rates and 4 days behind the percentages of COVID-19 ED visits and positive test results (either from CELR or NREVSS [i.e., early indicators]) (Table 1). Severity indicators that lagged behind hospital admission rates included inpatient and intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy (3–4 days) and deaths (8 days for NVSS and 21 days for aggregate death counts).
Rates of COVID-19–associated hospital admissions and percentages of inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, deaths that were COVID-19–associated, and ED visits with a diagnosis of COVID-19 had the highest mean correlations for capturing trends across all indicators (Table 2). Hospital admission rates exhibited both a high signal-to-noise ratio and a low geographic consistency, suggesting that this indicator might provide more easily interpretable and reliable information than others. Since October 2020, correlation was strong (7) between death rates from NVSS and aggregate death counts (0.79) and between NREVSS and CELR positive test results (0.79); correlation since April 2022 was lower for deaths (0.41) and slightly lower for positive test results (0.70).
Estimated ratios for percentage of positive test results relative to hospital admission rates from both CELR and NREVSS have increased since April 2022 related to decreased testing volumes, although CELR was more affected, possibly related to differential reporting of negative results (Table 1) (Figure).¶¶ The ratios for percentage of ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, percentage of deaths that are COVID-19–associated, and rates of COVID-19 deaths have decreased relative to hospital admissions since April 2022, likely due to decreased severity of recent infections as a consequence of high population levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity, improvements in medical treatment, and changes in variants over time.
A comparison of CCL and COVID-19 hospital admission level designations (low, medium, or high) by week during February 2022–March 2023 demonstrated >99% concordance among 3,220 counties (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127731). Most discordant levels were reported during periods of high COVID-19 incidence during February and March 2022. When the levels were discordant, CCLs exceeded the hospital admission levels.

Discussion
This evaluation of national COVID-19 surveillance data sources and indicators was performed in anticipation of the transition from the COVID-19 pandemic response to routine public health activities that require sustainable sources of surveillance data and reliable indicators after the end of the public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023. The evaluation determined that hospital admission rates are a suitable and timely primary indicator for monitoring COVID-19 trends. Using COVID-19 mortality data from NVSS improves timeliness for monitoring disease severity by up to 13 days. Leading indicators such as the percentage of ED visits with a COVID-19 diagnosis and percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results can capture changes in trends approximately 4 days earlier than hospital admission rates and provide complementary monitoring information, albeit with more limited geographic coverage.
COVID-19–associated hospital admission rates are available down to the level of the health service area, which is mapped to counties (1). The high concordance with CCLs is not surprising, because COVID-19 hospital admissions are the primary driver of CCLs and apply identical threshold levels, ensuring continuity beyond the public health emergency. One limitation of the existing level thresholds is insufficient granularity to detect changes during periods of low incidence; further monitoring and analysis would be needed before adjusting thresholds.
Early in the pandemic, aggregate death reporting provided more up-to-date death counts than did NVSS, but timeliness for the two systems has become more similar over time because of improvements in NVSS death certificate data processing (8). Analysis of the NVSS data by date of death makes the impact of reporting delays on recent deaths more apparent than aggregate death data by date of report (i.e., backfill death counts are assigned to recent report dates rather than the dates when the deaths occurred). However, NVSS data elements are more complete (e.g., for race and ethnicity), and the percentage of COVID-19 deaths from NVSS is not biased by incomplete reporting in recent weeks because death certificate data from COVID-19 and all causes have similar timeliness (4).
Over the course of the pandemic, the NSSP network has expanded considerably with ED visit data available for most jurisdictions (1). The data source for percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results will change from CELR to NREVSS after the public health emergency declaration expires and will be reported at the regional level because of limited numbers of reporting laboratories in some states (1). Voluntary reporting to NREVSS has been used for many years to track the percentage of positive test results for numerous respiratory viruses including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (5).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, it was not possible to distinguish between lags related to time to event (e.g., time from infection until death) and reporting delays. Further, retrospective findings do not account for reporting lags affecting recent data or potential future changes to reporting cadence (e.g., change from daily to weekly reporting), including for hospitalization data (1). As such, the lags presented serve as lower bounds on the effective lag when using these data for real-time monitoring, especially for recent weeks with incomplete reporting. Second, data availability is changing with the end of public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023, and data availability and quality will likely continue to change over time, potentially affecting their utility for COVID-19 monitoring. The current analysis focused on available data sources moving forward. Finally, this national evaluation used states and territories as a geographic unit of analysis, but findings might vary by jurisdiction based on geographic heterogeneity. This report can serve as a model for similar evaluations that could be undertaken at state levels.
COVID-19 hospital admission rates from NHSN are a timely and suitable primary indicator for monitoring trends in COVID-19 activity. Using the percentage of COVID-19 deaths from NVSS will allow more timely monitoring of COVID-19 severity and mortality trends. The percentage of COVID-19 ED visits and percentage of positive test results can serve as early indicators for COVID-19 trend monitoring. Collectively, these surveillance data sources and indicators can support monitoring of the impact of COVID-19 and related prevention and control strategies as ongoing public health priorities.

† As of December 15, 2022, COVID-19 hospital data are required to be reported to CDC’s NHSN, which monitors national and local trends in health care system stress, capacity, and community disease levels for approximately 6,000 hospitals in the United States. Data reported by hospitals to NHSN represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to hospital capacity, occupancy, hospitalizations, and admissions. Before December 15, 2022, hospitals reported data directly to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or via a state submission for collection in the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System.
§ CCLs are a composite metric using COVID-19 hospital admissions per 100,000 population, the percentage of inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients from NHSN, and COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population from aggregate case reporting at the county or county-equivalent level. Because of the choice of thresholds for each of these data elements, the hospital admissions rate is the primary determinant of the CCL for any county, and CCLs for each county will be as high as or higher than the corresponding COVID-19 hospital admission level (i.e., categorized using identical rate thresholds).
¶ NVSS data also contained suppressed values for areas and weeks with counts between 1 and 9. Suppressed counts were treated as 1 when calculating percentage of deaths and deaths per 100,000 population. A sensitivity analysis that replaced suppressed counts with 9 obtained similar results.
** Negative lags correspond to indicators that precede hospital admissions, and positive lags correspond to indicators that follow admissions. Null values were omitted during these calculations.
†† This model took the form y = mx + b where x represents the hospital admission rate, y represents the indicator of interest, the slope m represents the ratio between indicators, and the intercept b was fixed at zero. In this formulation, the ratio can be interpreted as the increase in the indicator of interest (y) corresponding to a one-unit increase in admissions per 100,000 population (x).

* Moving 7-day averages were used for all indicators. These averages were available daily for all data sources except NVSS and NREVSS, which were available weekly.
† Cross-correlation was used to calculate the lag (number of days) in indicators relative to hospital admissions as follows: Spearman’s correlations between indicators compared with hospital admission rates per 100,000 population were computed over a moving 12-week window. The offset (ranging from −35 days to 35 days) in indicators that produced the highest mean correlation across all windows and states is displayed. Negative lags correspond to indicators that lead admissions and positive lags correspond to indicators that lag admissions.
§ A linear regression model y = mx + b was fit where x represents the hospital admission rate, y represents the indicator of interest, m represents the ratio between indicators, and the intercept b was fixed at zero, such that for a one-unit rise in admissions per 100,000 population (x), the indicator of interest (y) will increase by the ratio value.
¶ To categorize indicators for data visualized in maps on COVID Data Tracker, the calculated ratios were used to identify thresholds for each indicator that were anchored to hospital admission rates used in the CCLs (10 and 20 admissions per 100,000 population), but the lower two categories were divided to increase resolution during periods of lower incidence (five, 10, 15, and 20 admissions per 100,000 population).

† Autocorrelations (Spearman’s) were used to assess the signal-to-noise ratio for each indicator (compared with itself but offset by 7 days); indicators were ranked based on autocorrelation.
§ Geographic consistency was evaluated using a metric calculated by computing daily z-scores for each indicator, averaging these scores by state, and computing the standard deviation over all states. Surveillance indicators with lower values for the geographic consistency metric are less likely to have jurisdictions consistently reporting indicator values higher or lower than the average.

Tinea is a common, highly contagious, superficial infection of the skin, hair, or nails caused by dermatophyte molds.* During the past decade, an epidemic of severe, antifungal-resistant tinea has emerged in South Asia because of the rapid spread of Trichophyton indotineae,† a novel dermatophyte species; the epidemic has likely been driven by misuse and overuse of topical antifungals and corticosteroids§ (1,2). T. indotineae infections are highly transmissible and characterized by widespread, inflamed, pruritic plaques on the body (tinea corporis), the crural fold, pubic region, and adjacent thigh (tinea cruris), or the face (tinea faciei) (1). T. indotineae isolates are frequently resistant to terbinafine, a mainstay of tinea treatment (1,3). T. indotineae infections have been reported throughout Asia and in Europe and Canada but have not previously been described in the United States (3).
On February 28, 2023, a New York City dermatologist notified public health officials of two patients who had severe tinea that did not improve with oral terbinafine treatment, raising concern for potential T. indotineae infection; these patients shared no epidemiologic links. Skin culture isolates from each patient were previously identified by a clinical laboratory as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and were subsequently forwarded to the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, for further review and analysis. Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal gene, followed by phylogenetic analysis performed during March 2023, identified the isolates as T. indotineae (Supplementary Figure; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127678). Activity related to this investigation was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶
Patient A, a woman aged 28 years, developed a widespread pruritic eruption during summer 2021. She had a first dermatologic evaluation in December 2021, at which time she was in her third trimester of pregnancy. She had no other underlying medical conditions, no known exposures to a person with similar rash, and no recent international travel history. Dermatologists noted large, annular, scaly, pruritic plaques over the neck, abdomen, pubic region, and buttocks (Figure). She received a diagnosis of tinea and began oral terbinafine therapy in January 2022 after the birth of her baby. Because her eruptions did not improve after 2 weeks of therapy, terbinafine was discontinued, and she began itraconazole treatment. The rash resolved completely after completing a 4-week course of itraconazole; however, she is being monitored for potential recurrence of infection and the need for resumption of itraconazole.
Patient B, a woman aged 47 years with no major medical conditions, developed a widespread, pruritic eruption in summer 2022 while in Bangladesh. There, she received treatment with topical antifungal and steroid combination creams and noted that several family members were experiencing similar eruptions. After returning to the United States, she visited an emergency department three times during autumn 2022. She was prescribed hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment and diphenhydramine (visit 1), clotrimazole cream (visit 2), and terbinafine cream (visit 3) with no improvement. In December 2022, she was evaluated by dermatologists who noted widespread, discrete, scaly, annular, pruritic plaques affecting the thighs and buttocks (Figure). She received a 4-week course of oral terbinafine, but her symptoms did not improve. She then received a 4-week course of griseofulvin therapy, resulting in approximately 80% improvement. Itraconazole therapy is being considered pending further evaluation given the recent confirmation of suspected T. indotineae infection. Her son and husband, who live in the same house and report similar eruptions, are currently undergoing evaluation.
The cases in these two patients highlight several important points. Patient A had no recent international travel history, suggesting potential local U.S. transmission of T. indotineae. Health care providers should consider T. indotineae infection in patients with widespread tinea, particularly when eruptions do not improve with first-line topical antifungal agents or oral terbinafine. Culture-based identification techniques used by most clinical laboratories typically misidentify T. indotineae as T. mentographytes or T. interdigitale; correct identification requires genomic sequencing. Health care providers who suspect T. indotineae infection should contact their state or local public health department for assistance with testing,** which is available at certain public health laboratories and specialized academic and commercial laboratories. Successful treatment using oral itraconazole, a triazole antifungal, has been documented. However, providers should be aware of challenges with itraconazole absorption,†† which can lead to variable serum drug concentrations; itraconazole’s interactions with other drugs; the need for up to 12 weeks of therapy (3); and the documented emergence of triazole resistance (4,5). Antimicrobial stewardship efforts are essential to minimize the misuse and overuse of prescribed and over-the-counter antifungal drugs and corticosteroids. In addition, health care providers can educate patients about strategies to prevent the spread of the dermatophytes that cause tinea.§§ Finally, public health surveillance efforts and increased testing could help detect and monitor the spread of T. indotineae.

* Commonly known as “ringworm,” tinea is most often caused by dermatophyte molds belonging to the genus Trichophyton. The infection spreads easily by skin-to-skin contact with infected animals or persons, secondary spread from other affected body sites, and fomites. Most skin infections are localized and resolve with topical antifungal treatment, and oral antifungal therapy is generally reserved for cases that do not improve with topical treatment or those with extensive disease or infection of the hair follicles. https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/ringworm/definition.html
† The etiologic agent causing the epidemic of drug-resistant tinea in South Asia was initially identified as T. mentagrophytes ITS genotype VIII. However, based on recent genomic studies, scientists determined that these frequently terbinafine-resistant Trichophyton strains were sufficiently different from T. mentagrophytes to be considered a new species, T. indotineae.
§ The emergence and spread of T. indotineae in South Asian countries have been linked to the inappropriate use of widely available topical combination creams containing antifungals, antibiotics, and high-potency corticosteroids. https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/ringworm/dermatophyte-resistance.html

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Tobacco product use remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States.
What is added by this report?
In 2021, approximately 18.7% (46 million) of U.S. adults currently used any tobacco product. Cigarettes were the most frequently reported tobacco product (11.5%), followed by e-cigarettes (4.5%). During 2020–2021, the prevalence of cigarette smoking decreased, and prevalence of e-cigarette use increased.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Continued use of evidence-based comprehensive tobacco control strategies, including linguistically and culturally competent educational campaigns and innovative strategies, combined with Food and Drug Administration regulation of tobacco products will support activities and programs to further reduce tobacco-related disease, death, and disparities.

Commercial cigarette smoking among U.S. adults has declined during the preceding 5 decades (1,2); however, tobacco product use remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, and some populations continue to be disproportionately affected by tobacco use (1,2). To assess recent national estimates of commercial tobacco use among U.S. persons aged ≥18 years, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Cancer Institute analyzed 2021 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. In 2021, an estimated 46 million U.S. adults (18.7%) reported currently using any tobacco product, including cigarettes (11.5%), e-cigarettes (4.5%), cigars (3.5%), smokeless tobacco (2.1%), and pipes (including hookah)* (0.9%).† Among those who used tobacco products, 77.5% reported using combustible products (cigarettes, cigars, or pipes), and 18.1% reported using two or more tobacco products.§ The prevalence of current use of any tobacco product use was higher among the following groups: men; persons aged <65 years; persons of non-Hispanic other races; non-Hispanic White (White) persons¶; residents of rural (nonmetropolitan) areas; financially disadvantaged (income-to-poverty ratio = 0–1.99); lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) persons; those uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid; adults whose highest level of education was a general educational development (GED) certificate; who had a disability; and who had serious psychological distress. Continued surveillance of tobacco product use, implementation of evidence-based tobacco control strategies (e.g., hard-hitting media campaigns, smoke-free policies, and tobacco price increases), conducting linguistically and culturally appropriate educational campaigns, and FDA regulation of tobacco products will aid in reducing tobacco-related disease, death, and disparities among U.S. adults (3,4).
NHIS is an annual, nationally representative, household survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population.** In 2021, a total of 29,482 adults were surveyed†† (response rate = 50.9%) (5). Data were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates, adjusting for differences in selection probability and nonresponse. Use of five tobacco products was assessed: cigarettes, cigars (cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars), pipes (regular pipes, water pipes, or hookahs), e-cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, or dissolvable tobacco). In this report, tobacco use refers to commercial tobacco products and not to tobacco used for medicinal and spiritual purposes by some American Indian communities. Current cigarette smoking was defined as having ever smoked 100 or more cigarettes within one’s lifetime and smoking every day or some days at the time of survey. Current use of all other tobacco products was defined as use of the product every day or some days at the time of survey. Prevalence estimates for current use of any tobacco product, any combustible tobacco product, two or more tobacco products, and quit ratios§§ were calculated; for 2021, estimates were calculated overall and by sex, age group, race and ethnicity, U.S. Census Bureau region,¶¶ rural/urban designation,*** educational attainment (among adults aged ≥25 years), marital status, income-to-poverty ratio,††† sexual orientation,§§§ health insurance coverage,¶¶¶ disability,**** and presence of serious psychological distress.††††
The top five combinations of tobacco products reported among adults who reported use of two or more tobacco prod­ucts were determined. Previous year changes in tobacco product use prevalences were calculated. Changes in cigarette smoking during 2019–2021 by diagnosed depression§§§§ overall and among racial and ethnic groups were also calculated. SAS-Callable SUDAAN software (version 11.0.3; Research Triangle Institute) was used to conduct all analyses. Chi-square tests were used to test for statistical significance. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶¶
Among U.S. adults in 2021, 18.7% (an estimated 46.0 million) currently used any tobacco product, 14.5% (35.6 million) used any combustible tobacco product, and 3.4% (8.3 million) used two or more tobacco products. Nearly two thirds (66.5%) of adults who ever smoked cigarettes reported having quit (Table). Cigarettes were the most used tobacco product (11.5%; 28.3 million). Prevalence of use and estimated number of users of other tobacco products were as follows: e-cigarettes (4.5%; 11.1 million), cigars (3.5%; 8.6 million), smokeless tobacco (2.1%; 5.2 million), and pipes (0.9%; 2.3 million). Among persons who reported current tobacco product use, 77.5% used combustible tobacco products, and 18.1% used two or more tobacco products. During 2020–2021, a decrease in cigarette smoking prevalence from 12.5% to 11.5% was observed (p<0.01); however, the prevalence of e-cigarette use increased from 3.7% to 4.5% (p<0.01). No statistically significant changes in use prevalences were observed for other tobacco products.
Among adults reporting the use of two or more tobacco products, the most frequently reported combination was cigarettes and e-cigarettes (31.4%), followed by cigarettes and cigars (21.0%), cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (7.9%), e-cigarettes and cigars (7.0%), and cigarettes and pipes (3.7%); in addition, 29.0% of adults who currently used two or more tobacco products reported use of some other combination, including 14.0% who reported use of three or more products (Figure 1).
During 2019–2021, the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults who were ever told by a health care provider that they had depression (22.9%, 20.5%, and 19.4% in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively) was higher than that among those who had never been told that they had depression (12.3%, 10.9%, and 9.9% in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively) (Figure 2). Regardless of diagnosed depression status, statistically significant declines in the prevalence of cigarette smoking during 2019–2021 were noted overall, among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black); White; and Hispanic adults. During 2019–2021, among adults who ever had diagnosed depression, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was highest among non-Hispanic adults of other races in 2019 and 2020, and highest among Black adults in 2021. Among adults who never had diagnosed depression, cigarette smoking prevalence was similar among Black and White adults and was highest among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults (in 2020), and non-Hispanic adults of other races (2019 and 2021).
In 2021, the prevalence of any current tobacco product use was higher among men (24.1%) than among women (13.6%) (Table). It was also higher among persons aged 25–44 years (22.1%), 45–64 years (21.1%), and 18–24 years (17.0%) than among those aged ≥65 years (11.0%), and higher among non-Hispanic adults of other races (25.6%) or White (21.2%) adults than among Black (18.1%), Hispanic (12.4%), or non-Hispanic Asian (8.6%) adults. Prevalence was higher among adults living in the Midwest (22.1%) or the South (19.7%) U.S. Census Bureau regions than among those living in the Northeast (16.2%) or West (16.0%), as well as higher among those living in rural areas (26.2%) compared with those in urban areas (17.5%). A larger percentage of adults with a GED certificate (39.0%) reported current tobacco product use than did persons with other levels of education (range = 8.6%–24.4%). In addition, use prevalence was higher among persons who were divorced, separated, or widowed (21.3%) or single, never married, or not living with a partner (20.1%) than among those who were married or living with a partner (17.5%). Other sociodemographic groups with higher prevalences of current tobacco use included persons with low income (24.7%) compared with persons with middle (18.9%) or high income (14.8%), and LGB adults (27.4%) compared with heterosexual/straight adults (18.4%). Higher prevalences of tobacco use were reported by persons who were uninsured (28.4%) or insured by Medicaid (28.1%) than by persons who had some other public insurance (21.6%), private insurance (16.2%), or Medicare only (10.7%); by those with a disability (24.2%) compared with those who did not have a disability (18.2%); and by those who reported serious psychological distress (37.6%) compared with those who did not report serious psychological distress (18.0%).

Discussion
In 2021, approximately one in nine (11.5%) U.S. adults aged ≥18 years currently smoked cigarettes. Although this finding represents the lowest smoking prevalence recorded since 1965 (1), nearly one in five adults continue to use tobacco products. Cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products constitute the largest proportion of overall tobacco product use and are the foremost cause of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in the United States (1). Consistent with the declines during recent decades, the prevalence of cigarette smoking decreased during 2020–2021. Comprehensive tobacco control strategies (e.g., smoke-free laws, media campaigns such as Tips from Former Smokers, and price increases) at the national, state, and local levels likely contributed to the lower cigarette smoking prevalence (3,4).
Nearly one in five adults who currently used tobacco products used two or more products, with nearly one third of these persons (31.4%) reporting use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Further, the prevalence of e-cigarette use increased during 2020–2021. In addition to continued surveillance of tobacco product use, it is equally important to monitor use of combinations of tobacco products to characterize multiproduct use trends.
Adults identifying as LGB, living in rural areas, or who are uninsured or have Medicaid insurance continue to report high prevalences of tobacco product use (6). Further, smoking prevalence is higher among adults who ever had diagnosed depression than among those who never had diagnosed depression, although, consistent with previous studies, prevalence declined from 2019 to 2021 (1,6,7). Racial and ethnic differences in tobacco product use are more pronounced among adults who ever had diagnosed depression than among those who never had diagnosed depression. Racial and ethnic differences in smoking prevalence might be related to a combination of lived experiences, such as discrimination and frequent tobacco product advertising exposure: disproportionate tobacco product advertising in low-income neighborhoods or areas with high proportions of Black or AI/AN persons has been documented (1,8,9). Racial and ethnic differences in smoking prevalence by diagnosed depression might also be partially attributed to differences in access to mental health care and tobacco cessation services (8,9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, because NHIS is limited to noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian populations, results are not generalizable to institutionalized populations or persons in the military. Second, responses to questions were self-reported and were not validated by biochemical testing; however, self-reported smoking status has been determined to correlate with serum cotinine levels (10). Third, 2021 tobacco product estimates for AI/AN populations were not statistically reliable***** and therefore are not presented. Fourth, changes in the 2020 and 2021 NHIS survey administration from in-person to primarily telephone-based (because of the COVID-19 pandemic) might affect 2020 and 2021 estimates††††† (5). Finally, these data are cross-sectional, and trends in tobacco product use changes among individual persons cannot be assessed.
In 2021, the 11.5% prevalence of current cigarette smoking was less than the 12% end-of-decade goal set by Healthy People 2020§§§§§. Although cigarette smoking decreased over the past year, e-cigarette use increased, from 3.7% to 4.5%, largely driven by higher prevalence in use among persons aged 18–24 years. Further, declines in cigarette smoking among populations with diagnosed depression represent important successes in tobacco control (7). However, disparities in tobacco use remain. Continued implementation of evidence-based strategies, such as increasing the unit price of tobacco products, enforcing comprehensive smoke-free policies, and conducting linguistically and culturally appropriate educational campaigns, combined with FDA regulation of tobacco products and innovative strategies, will support activities and programs to reduce tobacco use and tobacco-related disparities (3,4).

* The use of regular pipe, water pipe, or hookah was assessed together using a single question. Interviewers could read the following sentences if necessary: “A hookah is a type of water pipe. It is sometimes called a ‘narghile’ (NAR-ge-lee) pipe. Do not include electronic hookahs or e-hookahs”; “Do not include electronic pipes or e-pipes”; “Do not include pipes filled with substances other than tobacco.”
† Categories are not mutually exclusive.
§ Current use of two or more tobacco products was defined as use either “every day” or “some days” of at least two or more of the following tobacco products: cigarettes (100 or more cigarettes during a person’s lifetime); cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars; pipes, water pipes, or hookahs; electronic cigarettes; or smokeless tobacco products.
¶ Hispanic persons could be of any race. All other groups were non-Hispanic. The following four non-Hispanic single-race categories were available for sampled adults in the 2021 NHIS public use files: 1) American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN); 2) Asian; 3) Black or African American; and 4), White. The “non-Hispanic, other” category includes those adults who were categorized as “non-Hispanic AI/AN and any other group” or “other single and multiple races.”

†† Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, typical data collection procedures were disrupted. During January–April 2021, contact with household members was attempted first via telephone, with subsequent personal visits allowed (a continuation of procedures from the latter part of 2020). Beginning in May 2021, interviewers returned to regular procedures, whereby first contact with household members was attempted in person, with follow-up allowed by telephone. Allowed personal visits varied by regional office, based on local COVID-19 rates. Interviewers were required to wear masks, practice social distancing, and be fully vaccinated if in-home interviews were conducted. During 2021, 62.8% of interviews were conducted at least partially by telephone compared with 34.3% of interviews in 2019.
§§ Quit ratio is the percentage of persons who have ever smoked (100 or more cigarettes during their lifetime) and have quit smoking.

§§§ Sexual orientation was determined using the question, “Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?” Response options included “gay,” “straight, that is, not gay,” “bisexual,” “something else,” and “I don’t know the answer” among male respondents, and “lesbian or gay,” “straight, that is, not lesbian or gay,” “bisexual,” “something else,” and “I don’t know the answer” among female respondents. Respondents were considered to be LGB if they responded “gay,” “lesbian or gay,” or “bisexual.”
¶¶¶ Private coverage: adults who had any comprehensive private insurance plan (including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations). Medicaid: adults aged <65 years; includes those who did not have private coverage, but had Medicaid or other state-sponsored health plans, including the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). For adults aged ≥65 years, those who did not have any private coverage but had Medicare and Medicaid or other state-sponsored health plans were categorized as having Medicaid. Medicare only: adults aged ≥65 years who only had Medicare coverage. Other coverage: adults who did not have private insurance, Medicaid, or other public coverages, but who had any type of military coverage, coverage from other government programs, or Medicare (adults aged <65 years). Uninsured: adults who did not indicate at the time of interview that they were covered under private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, a state-sponsored health plan, other government programs, or military coverage. Insurance coverage is “as of time of survey.”
**** Disability was defined based on self-reported presence of selected limitations including vision, hearing, mobility, remembering or concentrating, self-care, and communication.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Not ready-to-eat breaded, stuffed chicken products have repeatedly been a source of Salmonella outbreaks. On April 28, 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed to declare Salmonella an adulterant in these products.
What is added by this report?
During 1998–2022, 11 Salmonella outbreaks linked to these products were reported; 57% of samples per outbreak from patient homes and retail stores yielded Salmonella. Outbreaks continue to occur, although a smaller percentage of patients reported cooking the product in a microwave after labeling changes.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Outbreaks have continued despite consumer-based interventions. Additional control measures for Salmonella contamination by manufacturers could reduce Salmonella-involved illnesses associated with these products.

Not ready-to-eat (NRTE) breaded, stuffed chicken products (e.g., chicken stuffed with broccoli and cheese) typically have a crispy, browned exterior that can make them appear cooked. These products have been repeatedly linked to U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, despite changes to packaging initiated in 2006 to identify the products as raw and warn against preparing them in a microwave oven (microwave) (1–4). On April 28, 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed to declare Salmonella an adulterant* at levels of one colony forming unit per gram or higher in these products (5). Salmonella outbreaks associated with NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products during 1998–2022 were summarized using reports in CDC’s Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System (FDOSS), outbreak questionnaires, web postings, and data from the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)† and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Eleven outbreaks were identified in FDOSS. Among cultured samples from products obtained from patients’ homes and from retail stores during 10 outbreaks, a median of 57% of cultures per outbreak yielded Salmonella. The NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products were produced in at least three establishments.§ In the seven most recent outbreaks, 0%–75% of ill respondents reported cooking the product in a microwave and reported that they thought the product was sold fully cooked or did not know whether it was sold raw or fully cooked. Outbreaks associated with these products have occurred despite changes to product labels that better inform consumers that the products are raw and provide instructions on safe preparation, indicating that consumer-targeted interventions are not sufficient. Additional Salmonella controls at the manufacturer level to reduce contamination in ingredients might reduce illnesses attributable to NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products.
State health officials submit reports of foodborne Salmonella outbreaks to FDOSS. A foodborne outbreak is defined as the occurrence of a similar illness associated with a common food exposure in two or more persons. Salmonella outbreaks with mention of frozen, breaded, or stuffed chicken that occurred during 1998–2022 were identified in FDOSS; data for 2022 are incomplete. Search results were supplemented by information obtained from outbreak investigators, and a review of questionnaires administered to ill persons, web postings, product recall information, product sampling results, and data from MDH and FSIS.
Descriptive analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 4.0.2; R Foundation). The number of outbreaks, illnesses,¶ and hospitalizations; serotypes; setting where food was prepared; patient sex and age groups; type of chicken used in the products; testing results for food and environmental samples collected from patients’ homes or retail establishments; and product recalls were summarized. Product type and producing establishments were identified through traceback by Minnesota’s Departments of Agriculture and Health or by FSIS.
To examine the cooking practices of ill persons in outbreaks, and whether they believed the product was sold fully cooked, data collected from patient interviews during Minnesota and multistate outbreak investigations were summarized. Responses from outbreaks occurring during 2008–2021, after labeling changes were initiated in 2006, were compared with those from earlier outbreaks. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**
An NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken product was the confirmed†† food vehicle in 11 Salmonella outbreaks§§ that occurred during 1998–2022, comprising 187 cases of illness, 42 hospitalizations, and no deaths (Table 1). The outbreaks were caused by Salmonella serotypes Enteritidis (seven outbreaks), Typhimurium (two), Heidelberg (one), and I 4,[5],12:i- (one). In 10 of the 11 outbreaks, the products were prepared in private homes. Outbreak illnesses were identified in 21 U.S. states; five of six single-state outbreaks occurred in Minnesota and illnesses occurred in Minnesota in every multistate outbreak. Among 139 patients for whom data from 10 outbreaks were available, 73 (53%) were male and 64 (42%) of 153 patients were aged 20–49 years.
NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products were made with comminuted¶¶ chicken in the three 2015 and 2021 outbreaks. The type of chicken used during earlier outbreaks was not documented. FSIS issued product recalls in six outbreaks and public health alerts in seven.*** Product samples were collected from patients’ homes in nine outbreaks and from retail stores in 10.††† A median of 57% (range = 0%–100%) of samples per outbreak from patients’ homes and 57% (range = 11%–93%) of samples per outbreak from retail stores yielded Salmonella upon culture. An isolate from at least one product matched the patients’ serotype or strain in every outbreak in which product was sampled. The producing establishment was unknown for one outbreak; products in the other 10 outbreaks came from at least three producing establishments. Establishments A and B were implicated in five outbreaks each, and establishment C was implicated in three outbreaks. Establishments A and C are still operating; they are two of the six U.S. establishments that make these products.
Among 47 patients in four outbreaks during 1998–2006 (before product labeling changes) who provided data on the appliance used to cook the product, a median of 85% per outbreak (range = 67%–100%) reported cooking the product in a microwave; among 57 patients who provided these data from seven outbreaks during 2008–2021 (after labeling changes), a median of 20% per outbreak (range = 0%–75%) reported cooking the product in a microwave (Table 2). In four outbreaks that occurred during 1998–2006, among 37 patients who provided information about whether they thought the product was sold fully cooked, a median of 56% per outbreak (range = 33%–100%) reported that they thought the product was sold fully cooked or did not know whether it was sold raw or fully cooked. In six outbreaks during 2008–2021, among 34 patients who provided this information, a median of 27% per outbreak (range = 0%–75%) thought the product was sold fully cooked or did not know whether it was sold raw or fully cooked.

Discussion
Eleven Salmonella outbreaks linked to NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products (involving 187 patients) were reported in the United States during 1998–2022. Most of the products tested contained Salmonella. Products were produced by at least three establishments. Outbreaks have continued to occur despite changes made to product labels to better inform consumers and increase the percentages of persons who understand that the product is sold raw. Thus, stronger controls are needed to prevent illnesses associated with these products.
NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products can be made with various types of chicken, including comminuted, trimmings, or other parts. Certain chicken types are subject to FSIS performance standards, which are used to measure an establishment’s process control; the comminuted chicken used to make these products has the highest allowable percentage (13 of 52 [25%]) of Salmonella positives (6). On April 28, 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed to declare Salmonella an adulterant in NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products, meaning that the product will be subject to regulatory action if Salmonella is detected even at very low levels (5).
Canada enacted regulations for certain breaded chicken products after investigators identified 19 Salmonella outbreaks caused by NRTE breaded chicken products during 2015–2019 (7). These products were not stuffed; most were chicken nuggets. The government introduced four control options in nonstuffed products to reduce Salmonella to below detectable amounts in these products (7). In 2019, the incidence of illness caused by Salmonella Enteritidis, the serotype implicated in 89% of those outbreaks, was 33% lower than it was during 2015–2018 and 7% lower than during the baseline years 2010–2014 (8).
Consumer-based interventions alone, such as improved product labels, have not been an effective solution. In recent years, labels have recommended using a conventional oven rather than a microwave and using a food thermometer (3); however, a consumer research study found that even when consumers read the label, 12% did not realize the product was raw or partially cooked, and among consumers who owned a food thermometer, 52% reported that they typically did not use it while preparing this product (9). Although labeling changes can help protect consumers, the questionnaire data show that some persons who knew the product was raw and followed the cooking instructions still became ill. Moreover, label changes cannot address inequities in access to recommended cooking appliances (3).
The number of patients who became ill from these products is likely much higher than that indicated from outbreak reports. Many persons regularly eat these products: in a U.S. population survey, 7.4% reported eating these products in the previous week.§§§ Although implicated products were distributed nationally, MDH officials identified all multistate outbreaks, and almost one half of outbreaks had cases identified only in Minnesota, suggesting that some outbreaks occurred but were not identified in other states.
Illnesses even among persons who reported that they used a conventional oven and knew the product was raw indicate that consumer-based interventions have been insufficient. The high rate of contamination of products in outbreaks and the lack of first recognition of multistate outbreaks by a state other than Minnesota suggest that the prevalence of illness due to these products is higher than that indicated by outbreaks. Moreover, only a small proportion of all Salmonella illnesses are identified as such. Illness could be reduced by enhanced Salmonella control at the manufacturers that produce these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s proposal to declare Salmonella an adulterant in NRTE breaded and stuffed chicken products will bring additional focus to this public health problem and encourage producers to better control Salmonella in the ingredients used to produce these products.

* The circumstances under which a poultry product is considered adulterated are defined in the Poultry Products Inspection Act, which includes several conditions that result in a product’s being unsafe or harmful to health (21 U.S.C. 453 [g]).
† With one exception, MDH first identified and led the investigation for every outbreak described in this report, and also provided CDC with additional outbreak reports for each of the 10 outbreaks.
§ An establishment at which inspection of the slaughter of poultry, or the processing of poultry products, is maintained under the authority of 21 U.S.C. Chapter 10 Sect. 453p, as determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary.

†† NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products were considered the confirmed food vehicle when there was at least one type of evidence (epidemiologic, traceback, or laboratory testing) in point source outbreaks or at least two types of evidence in outbreaks with exposures in multiple venues or in more than one county or state. https://www.cdc.gov/nors/downloads/guidance.pdf
§§ MDH and FSIS investigated four additional clusters of illness suspected to be associated with NRTE breaded, stuffed chicken products; none met the National Outbreak Reporting System outbreak definition.
¶¶ Products that have been ground, mechanically separated, or hand- or mechanically deboned and further chopped, flaked, minced, or otherwise processed to reduce particle size.
*** FSIS defines a recall as a firm’s action to remove product from commerce to protect the public from consuming adulterated or misbranded product. Although recalling product is a firm’s decision, FSIS coordinates with the firm to ensure it has properly identified and removed recalled product from commerce by verifying the effectiveness of the firm’s recall activities. FSIS also notifies the public about product recalls. A public health alert is issued when there is reason to believe a meat or poultry product might be associated with human illness, but FSIS cannot identify a specific product that could be recalled (Directive 8080.1, 2013). Some of the outbreaks had both a public health alert and recall, some only a public health alert, and others only a recall.
††† No product samples were collected in the 2013 Washington Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak, and no product samples were taken from patients’ homes in the 2005 multistate Salmonella Heidelberg outbreak. Product sampling during the 2005 multistate Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak and the 2006 Minnesota Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak occurred together and the proportion of samples yielding Salmonella was only counted once in median calculations.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
More than 3.2 million persons died in the United States during January–December 2022.
What is added by this report?
The overall age-adjusted U.S. death rate decreased by 5.3% from 2021 to 2022. Overall death rates and COVID-19–associated death rates were highest among non-Hispanic Black or African American persons and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Provisional death estimates provide an early signal about shifts in mortality trends. Timely and actionable data can guide public health policies and interventions for populations experiencing higher mortality.

The National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) collects and reports annual mortality statistics using U.S. death certificate data. Because of the time needed to investigate certain causes of death and to process and review death data, final annual mortality data for a given year are typically released 11 months after the end of the calendar year. Provisional data, which are based on the current flow of death certificate data to NCHS, provide an early estimate of deaths, before the release of final data. NVSS routinely releases provisional mortality data for all causes of death and for deaths associated with COVID-19.* This report is an overview of provisional U.S. mortality data for 2022, including a comparison with 2021 death rates. In 2022, approximately 3,273,705 deaths† occurred in the United States. The estimated 2022 age-adjusted death rate decreased by 5.3%, from 879.7 per 100,000 persons in 2021 to 832.8. COVID-19 was reported as the underlying cause or a contributing cause in an estimated 244,986 (7.5%) of those deaths (61.3 deaths per 100,000). The highest overall death rates by age, race and ethnicity, and sex occurred among persons who were aged ≥85 years, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), and male. In 2022, the four leading causes of death were heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, and COVID-19. Provisional death estimates provide an early indication of shifts in mortality trends and can guide public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing mortality, including deaths directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
NCHS analyzed provisional NVSS death certificate data for deaths occurring among U.S. residents in the United States during January–December 2022. Deaths among residents of U.S. territories and foreign countries were excluded. The number and rates of overall deaths and COVID-19–associated deaths were tabulated by age, sex, and race and ethnicity (categorized as AI/AN, non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], Black, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic White [White], non-Hispanic persons of more than one race [multiracial], unknown, or Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic]). NCHS coded the causes of death according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, which details disease classification and the designation of underlying cause of death (1,2). COVID-19–associated death counts and rates include deaths for which COVID-19 was listed on the death certificate as an underlying or contributing cause of death.§ COVID-19 was the underlying cause for approximately 76% (186,702) of COVID-19–associated deaths in 2022 (3). Leading causes of death were ranked by counts based on underlying cause of death (4). Age was unknown for 101 (<0.01%) decedents, and race and ethnicity were unknown for 10,086 (0.31%). The trends in deaths during the year were determined by calculating the number of deaths for each week from all causes and from COVID-19. Age-adjusted death rates were calculated for deaths overall and by sex and race and ethnicity. Crude death rates were calculated by age. The population data used to calculate death rates are July 1, 2021 estimates based on the Blended Base produced by the U.S. Census Bureau (5,6). Unless otherwise specified, rate comparisons in the text are statistically significant (p<0.05).
In 2022, approximately 3,273,705 deaths occurred in the United States (Table). The age-adjusted rate, 832.8 deaths per 100,000 standard population, represented a decrease of 5.3% from 879.7 in 2021 (7). The total number of deaths peaked during the weeks ending January 22, 2022 (85,405 deaths) and December 31, 2022 (69,664) (Figure 1). In 2022, total death rates were lowest among persons aged 5–14 years (14.8 per 100,000) and highest among persons aged ≥85 years (15,605.2), similar to patterns in 2021 (Table). Overall death rates decreased for all age groups ≥15 years from 2021 to 2022, while the death rate increased from 25.0 to 26.9 per 100,000 among persons aged 1–4 years during the same period. The changes in overall death rates for age groups <1 year and 5–14 years were not significant. Age-adjusted death rates were higher among males compared with females in 2021 (1,048.0 and 733.3, respectively) and 2022 (984.8 and 700.9, respectively); however, from 2021 to 2022, the death rates decreased 6.0% among males and 4.4% among females.
During 2022, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying or contributing cause of 244,986 deaths (61.3 per 100,000), a 47% decrease from 462,193 deaths (115.6 per 100,000) in 2021. The COVID-19–associated death rate decreased from 2021 to 2022 among age groups ≥15 years, and the rate increased for all age groups <15 years. As with deaths overall, the age-adjusted COVID-19–associated death rate among males (76.3) was higher compared with that among females (49.8).
Age-adjusted death rates differed by race and ethnicity and decreased for all groups from 2021 to 2022. Overall age-adjusted death rates were lowest among multiracial (394.2) and Asian persons (447.2) and highest among Black (1,028.0) and AI/AN (973.3) persons. COVID-19–associated death rates declined from 2021 to 2022 for all racial and ethnic groups.
During 2022, the three leading causes of death were heart disease (699,659 deaths), cancer (607,790), and unintentional injury (218,064) (Figure 2).¶ COVID-19, listed as the underlying cause for 186,702 deaths during 2022, ranked as the fourth leading underlying cause of death. COVID-19 was the underlying cause for 5.7% of all deaths in 2022, decreasing from 12.0% (416,893 deaths) in 2021. Heart disease and cancer deaths increased in 2022 compared with 2021 (accounting for 695,547 and 605,213, deaths respectively), while deaths associated with COVID-19 decreased.

Discussion
During January–December 2022, the estimated 2022 U.S. age-adjusted death rate decreased by 5.3% to 832.8 per 100,000 persons, from 879.7 in 2021. Overall death rates were highest among males, older adults, and Black persons. The highest weekly numbers of overall deaths and COVID-19–associated deaths occurred during January and December. The three leading causes of death in 2022 were heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injury. COVID-19, the third leading cause of death in 2021, fell to fourth place in 2022 because of the large decrease in COVID-19–associated deaths compared with those in 2021 (7). The number of deaths caused by unintentional injury, largely driven by a high number of drug overdose deaths, remained high in 2022 compared with 2021 (8).
Overall death rates and COVID-19–associated death rates decreased from 2021 to 2022 for most demographic groups, with the exception of certain age groups. COVID-19–associated death rates increased for all persons aged <15 years. Although the overall and COVID-19–associated death rates decreased for persons aged ≥85 years from 2021 to 2022, rates remained higher for this group compared with all other age groups. In addition, although overall and COVID-19–associated death rates decreased among all racial and ethnic groups, age-adjusted total and COVID-19–associated death rates remained high for Black and AI/AN persons compared with other groups. The current report did not examine death rates for causes of death other than COVID-19; however, available provisional data from the CDC WONDER platform indicate death rate patterns for leading causes of death (9). The age-adjusted rate of heart disease deaths increased for the third straight year since 2020. While the age-adjusted rate of cancer deaths had declined steadily during 1999–2020, the cancer death rate increased in 2021 and 2022. Further analysis of provisional data might offer additional insights into demographic patterns of leading causes of death.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data are provisional, and numbers and rates might change as additional information is received. Described changes in mortality trends might be underestimates. Second, timeliness of death certificate submission can vary by jurisdiction. As a result, the national distribution of deaths might be affected by the distribution of deaths reported from jurisdictions reporting later, which might differ from those in the United States overall. Finally, potential exists for misclassification of certain categories of race (i.e., AI/AN and Asian) and Hispanic ethnicity reported on death certificates (10). Thus, death rates for some groups might be under- or overestimated.
This report provides an overview of provisional mortality in the United States during 2022. Provisional death estimates can offer researchers and policymakers an early signal about shifts in mortality trends and provide actionable information sooner than do the final mortality data, which are released approximately 11 months after the end of the data year. These data can guide public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and among persons most affected, including persons who are older, male, or from members of certain racial and ethnic minority groups.

§ The underlying cause of death is the disease or injury that initiated the chain of morbid events leading directly to death.
¶ In this report, the number of deaths caused by unintentional injury was tabulated using the internal NVSS mortality database and might not match publicly available provisional counts for deaths for unintentional injury because provisional data for injury-related causes of death are publicly released with a lag of 6 months from the date of death. This delay accounts for the additional time typically needed to report injury-related death certificates, and the final 2022 death count might be higher than noted in this report.

The National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) collects and reports annual mortality statistics using U.S. death certificate data. Provisional data, which are based on the current flow of death certificate data to NCHS, provide an early estimate of deaths before the release of final data.* This report summarizes provisional U.S. COVID-19 death data for 2022. In 2022, COVID-19 was the underlying (primary) or contributing cause in the chain of events leading to 244,986 deaths† that occurred in the United States. During 2021–2022, the estimated age-adjusted COVID-19–associated death rate decreased 47%, from 115.6 to 61.3 per 100,000 persons. COVID-19 death rates were highest among persons aged ≥85 years, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations, and males. In 76% of deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death. In the remaining 24% of COVID-19 deaths, COVID-19 was a contributing cause. As in 2020 and 2021, during 2022, the most common location of COVID-19 deaths was a hospital inpatient setting (59%). However, an increasing percentage occurred in the decedent’s home (15%), or a nursing home or long-term care facility (14%).§ Provisional COVID-19 death estimates provide an early indication of shifts in mortality trends and can help guide public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing COVID-19–associated mortality.
This report analyzed provisional NVSS death certificate data for deaths among U.S. residents within the United States during January–December 2022. COVID-19–associated death counts and rates include deaths for which COVID-19 was listed on the death certificate as an underlying or contributing cause of death. NCHS tabulated the number and rates of COVID-19 deaths by age, sex, and race and ethnicity (categorized as AI/AN, non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], non-Hispanic Black [Black], non-Hispanic Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic White [White], Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], non-Hispanic persons of more than one race [multiracial], and unknown), and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region of residence. NVSS data in this report exclude deaths among residents of U.S. territories and foreign countries. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶
NCHS coded the causes of death according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, which details disease classification and the designation of underlying cause of death (1,2). The underlying cause of death is the disease or injury that initiated the chain of morbid events leading directly to death. Contributing causes are conditions that are also part of the chain of events leading to death. Among all deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, the leading causes of death were ranked by number of deaths per underlying cause of death (3). Race and ethnicity were unknown for 679 (0.28%) decedents and age was unknown for four (<0.01%). Age-adjusted death rates were calculated by sex, race and ethnicity, and residence. Crude death rates were calculated by age. The population data used to calculate deaths rates are July 1, 2021 estimates, based on the Blended Base produced by the U.S. Census Bureau (4,5). Place of death is noted on the death certificate and is determined by both the location where the death was pronounced and the physical location where the death occurred (6). In this report, place of death is categorized as decedent’s home, hospice facility, hospital inpatient setting, hospital outpatient or emergency department, nursing home or long-term care facility, or other (which includes being dead on arrival, other, and unknown).
In 2022, COVID-19 was listed as an underlying or contributing cause of 244,986 (61.3 per 100,000) deaths (Table 1). COVID-19–associated death rates were lowest among children and adolescents aged 5–14 years (0.5) and highest among adults aged ≥85 years (1,224.2). In 2022, similar to previous years, the age-adjusted COVID-19–associated death rate for males (76.3) was higher than that for females (49.8). Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates were lowest in multiracial (26.7) and Asian persons (34.1) and highest in AI/AN persons (86.8).
The COVID-19–associated age-adjusted death rate was lowest (49.5 per 100,000) in HHS Region 1 (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) and highest (69.3) in Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). The second highest age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate (65.5) and highest number of COVID-19–associated deaths (56,695) occurred in Region 4 (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee).
For surveillance purposes, and in this report, COVID-19-associated deaths are deaths with COVID-19 as an underlying or contributing cause of death. In 2022, among deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause in 76% of deaths (Table 2). For deaths with COVID-19 listed as a contributing cause, heart disease and cancer were the next most frequent underlying causes, listed in 6% and 4% of deaths, respectively. Other underlying causes of death for COVID-19–associated deaths included chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, unintentional injuries, kidney disease, and Parkinson disease. COVID-19 was listed as the sole cause of death on 3.6% of death records in 2022, compared with 5.6% in both 2020 and 2021. In 2022, COVID-19 deaths that listed additional causes of death included an average of 4.5 listed contributing causes, compared with 4.2 in 2021 and 4.0 in 2020.
In 2022, approximately 59% of COVID-19–associated deaths occurred in a hospital inpatient setting, followed by 15% in the decedent’s home, and 14% in a nursing home or long-term care facility. The three most common places of death for COVID-19 deaths have remained similar since the beginning of the pandemic, but the proportion of deaths occurring in each setting has shifted over time (Figure). The percentage of deaths occurring in a hospital inpatient setting decreased from nearly 70% during 2020–2021 to approximately 60% in 2022.

Discussion
During January–December 2022, 244,986 deaths with COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death occurred among U.S. residents. The age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate was 61.3 per 100,000 persons. COVID-19–associated death rates were highest among males, older adults, and AI/AN persons. The COVID-19–associated age-adjusted death rate varied by HHS region, with the lowest rates in New England (Region 1) and highest rates in the south central United States (Region 6).
Some demographic characteristics of COVID-19–associated deaths have remained similar since 2020; however, changes in other characteristics have occurred over time. During the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause on approximately 90% of death certificates. In 2022, the percentage of deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause decreased to 76% (7). Changes were also observed in the setting where COVID-19 deaths are occurring. Whereas most COVID-19 deaths still occur in hospital inpatient settings, the proportion of those deaths decreased in 2022, as more deaths occurred in decedents’ homes and nursing homes or long-term care facilities.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data are provisional, and numbers and rates might change as additional information is received. Described changes in mortality trends might be underestimates. Second, timeliness of death certificate submission can vary by jurisdiction. As a result, the national or regional distribution of deaths might be affected by the distribution of deaths reported from jurisdictions reporting later, which might differ from those in the United States or in a region overall. Finally, potential exists for misclassification of certain categories of race (i.e., AI/AN and Asian) and Hispanic ethnicity reported on death certificates (8). Thus, death rates for some groups might be under- or overestimated.
This report provides an overview of COVID-19–associated mortality in the United States in 2022 and highlights changes in the characteristics of COVID-19 deaths. These data provide updated information that advances understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 on mortality and how these have continued to shift during the course of the pandemic. These findings also help to guide public health policies and interventions intended to reduce severe COVID-19 impact by providing insight into groups that remain vulnerable to COVID-19–associated mortality.

On the afternoon of September 28, 2022 (epidemiologic week 40), Hurricane Ian made landfall on Florida’s southwest coast as a category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hr (241 km per hr). The storm surge (the abnormal rise in seawater related to a storm) reached 12–18 ft (3.6–5.5 m) above ground level in some coastal areas of Lee and Collier counties, on southwest Florida’s Gulf coast (1). In the days after the hurricane, a notable increase in cases of vibriosis was observed by the Florida Department of Health: 38 cases and 11 vibriosis-associated deaths were attributed to the storm. During the hurricane response, Florida deployed public health messaging on storm preparedness statewide, advising residents of 1) the importance of not wading in flood waters or in standing water after a storm, especially persons with open wounds; 2) the potential life-threatening illness that can be caused by Vibrio vulnificus; and the importance of seeking prompt medical attention if symptoms* are experienced (2).
Vibrio bacteria thrive in warm salty or brackish waters such as those pushed ashore in a storm surge. These virulent gram-negative bacteria can result in gastrointestinal illness after consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, or a skin infection following exposure of an open wound to salt or brackish water (a mixture of freshwater and seawater) (3). This data was obtained through routine investigation of vibriosis cases and follow- up using Florida’s reportable disease surveillance system Merlin. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
In the week preceding the hurricane (week 39), southwest Florida reported no vibriosis cases, which was below the 5-year median (three cases) for that week. Based on epidemiology from previous years, three vibriosis cases were expected to be reported in southwest Florida in the weeks during and after the storm (weeks 40 and 41). However, 38 culture-confirmed vibriosis cases determined to be associated with the impacts of Hurricane Ian occurred in Lee and Collier counties during September 29–October 23, representing an 1,100% increase over the 5-year median. These cases included 29 (76%) caused by V. vulnificus, three cases (8%) by Vibrio cholerae type non-O1, and two cases (5%) each by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio fluvialis, and other Vibrio spp. One case occurred in a resident of another state who was exposed in Florida, and one patient was co-infected with V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus. The median patient age was 80 years (range = 51–94 years), and 79% of the 38 cases occurred in men. Date of symptom onset ranged from September 28 to October 9; onset dates for two patients were unknown. Among 36 (95%) patients with known illness onset date, 34 (94%) cases occurred within 6 days of storm landfall (Figure).
Thirty-three (87%) patients had skin infections associated with exposure to storm surge or flood waters; two (5%) reported wounds with unclear exposures; two (5%) reported prolonged exposure to flood waters after being trapped in their homes or while evacuating; and one patient (3%) reported drinking flood waters. Thirty-six patients were hospitalized for a median of 10 days (range = 1–51 days), and eight (22%) were transferred to skilled nursing facilities or rehabilitation facilities after hospitalization. Eight patients required skin grafts, and three underwent lower extremity amputations. Among the 11 (29%) deaths that occurred, nine occurred in patients infected with V. vulnificus, and one death each occurred in patients infected with V. cholerae non-O1 and with some other Vibrio sp.
This outbreak is notable because of the large number of hurricane-attributable cases that occurred during a short period. The case fatality rate was 28.9%, which might be related to the age of many of the patients. In 2017, after Hurricane Irma, six storm-related vibriosis cases were documented in Florida, approximately one sixth the number documented after Ian, possibly because of the lower storm surge (5–6 ft [1.5–1.8 m]) during Irma. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina resulted in the highest storm surge in U.S. history (>25 ft [7.6 m]); 22 vibriosis cases were linked to that storm, all of which resulted in disease onset within 7 days of storm landfall (4). Communicating risk information to the public and to health care providers before an event with potential for significant storm surge, such as a major hurricane, might prevent cases and assist in the timely diagnosis and treatment of vibriosis. In hurricane-associated wound infections, V. vulnificus should be considered as a possible cause, aggressive wound care and prompt administration of antibiotics is essential to improving survival (5).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in Maricopa County, Arizona. Since WNV was first detected in 2003, four outbreaks have occurred.
What is added by this report?
In 2021, Maricopa County experienced its fifth, and largest, WNV outbreak reported in the county: 1,487 cases, 1,014 (68%) hospitalizations, and 101 (7%) deaths, taxing a stressed health care system during the COVID-19 pandemic.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Clinicians should consider WNV testing in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with a clinically compatible illness. Public health agencies should continually review messaging to improve awareness. Human and mosquito surveillance is essential to mounting a rapid, coordinated response and limiting further spread.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquitoborne disease primarily transmitted through bites of infected Culex species mosquitos (1). In the United States, WNV is the leading domestically acquired arboviral disease; it can cause severe illness affecting the brain and spinal cord with an associated case fatality rate of 10% (2,3). On September 2, 2021, Maricopa County Environmental Services Department, Vector Control Division (MCESD-VCD) notified the Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH) and the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) that the WNV vector index (VI), a measure of infected Culex mosquitoes, was substantially elevated. By that date, at least 100 WNV cases had already been reported among Maricopa County residents to MCDPH by health care providers and laboratories. Within 2 weeks, the VI reached its highest ever recorded level (53.61), with an associated tenfold increase in the number of human disease cases. During 2021, a total of 1,487 human WNV cases were identified; 956 (64.3%) patients had neuroinvasive disease, and 101 (6.8%) died. MCESD-VCD conducted daily remediation efforts to mitigate elevated VI and address mosquito-related complaints from residents (i.e., large numbers of outdoor mosquitoes from an unknown source and unmaintained swimming pools potentially breeding mosquitoes). MCDPH increased outreach to the community and providers through messaging, education events, and media. This was the largest documented focal WNV outbreak in a single county in the United States (4). Despite outreach efforts to communities and health care partners, clinicians and patients reported a lack of awareness of the WNV outbreak, highlighting the need for public health agencies to increase prevention messaging to broaden public awareness and to ensure that health care providers are aware of recommended testing methods for clinically compatible illnesses.

Investigation and Results
WNV, an arthropod-borne arbovirus, is primarily transmitted through bites of infected Culex mosquitoes and is the leading cause of domestically acquired arbovirus infections in the United States (1). Transmission is also possible through blood transfusions; since 2005, the Food and Drug Administration has recommended WNV nucleic acid testing of minipools consisting of combined individual blood donation samples, with an automatic switch to individual donation testing upon detection of a positive result (5). Persons with a WNV-positive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test result are reported to public health. Health care providers are required to report patients within 5 working days of detection, diagnosis, or treatment of a suspected or confirmed WNV infection; laboratories are required to report positive WNV test results within the same period. WNV case reports are stored within the Arizona Medical Electronic Disease Surveillance Intelligence System.*,† MCDPH investigates reports of positive WNV laboratory test results, classifies them according to national case definitions (6), and regularly communicates with health care providers via a mass notification system (SurvAlert) regarding community health threats. MCDPH responds to WNV outbreaks in partnership with MCESD-VCD, with support from ADHS.
No vaccine or specific therapy exists for WNV; thus, treatment is supportive. The case fatality rate in persons with neuroinvasive disease is 10% (2,3). The frequency and location of outbreaks vary annually and are challenging to predict (1). In Arizona, WNV was first detected in 2003 (12 cases); the majority of cases occurred among Maricopa County residents (2). The largest outbreak previously recorded in Maricopa County occurred in 2004 (355 cases).
MCESD-VCD conducts vector surveillance and abatement§ based on resident complaints of mosquito abundance and routine mosquito trap deployments in specific locations throughout the county.¶ When mosquitoes are found in traps, MCESD-VCD organizes them into groups (pools) of up to 50 female Culex spp. mosquitoes to be tested as one sample. Each pool is then tested for WNV using RT-PCR; a positive mosquito pool is one in which the sample is WNV-positive. From this testing, MCESD-VCD calculates a VI (the estimated proportion of infected mosquitoes of a particular species in a specific area collected during weekly mosquito surveillance). The highest VI previously recorded in Maricopa County was 19.4 in 2019 (7). When the VI exceeds 3.0 (based on analysis of data from previous seasons), MCESD-VCD notifies MCDPH that an increase in human WNV cases is anticipated within 2–3 weeks. Laboratory processing and notification of VI to MCDPH lags throughout the season (approximately 1–2 weeks). ADHS coordinates confirmatory human WNV testing with the Arizona State Public Health Laboratory and CDC, monitors WNV surveillance data statewide, provides resources, and issues health alert notifications (HANs).
On May 4, 2021, MCESD-VCD notified MCDPH of the first 2021 WNV-positive mosquito pool. MCESD-VCD continued mosquito surveillance and commenced application of adulticides based on WNV-positive pools. On June 11, MCESD-VCD notified MCDPH that the VI had exceeded 3.0 (Figure). MCDPH enhanced routine surveillance by forwarding WNV IgM-positive serum and CSF specimens collected from persons with suspected WNV cases to the Arizona State Public Health Laboratory (ASPHL) for confirmatory testing. WNV-positive RT-PCR samples are considered confirmatory tests and were not forwarded to ASPHL. On August 12, the VI had increased by approximately 127% from the previous week (from 5.11 to 11.57). By September 2, the WNV VI was 46.72, peaking the week of September 11 at 53.61; the highest level ever recorded in the county. A VI peak this late in the season (i.e., in September) has occurred twice before in Maricopa County, in 2014 (VI = 9.6) and 2018 (VI = 7.9).
During 2021, MCDPH identified 1,487 confirmed or probable human WNV cases and an additional 78 asymptomatic viremic blood donors. The majority (95%) of persons with WNV had illness onset during a 12-week period during August 15–November 6, 2021. On September 25, the outbreak peaked at 236 cases reported in a single week. The last adulticide application occurred November 9. The last positive mosquito trap was identified the week of November 14; adulticide was not applied because the temperatures had decreased to <50°F (<10°C); according to manufacturer instructions, the material cannot be applied at these temperatures.**,††
Among the 1,487 WNV cases, 956 (64.3%) were classified as neuroinvasive disease, and 101 (6.8%) patients died; all deaths occurred among patients with neuroinvasive disease (Table). In addition to the 78 asymptomatic WNV reports identified through routine blood donation screening, 25 of the 1,487 WNV cases were identified as blood donors with symptomatic WNV; one of these symptomatic patients was diagnosed with neuroinvasive disease. The median age among all patients was 66 years (IQR = 53–75 years), and among those who died, the median age was 79 years (IQR = 71–83 years). Most cases occurred in persons who were White (78%), non-Hispanic or Latino (76%), and male (57%). In total, 1,014 (68.2%) patients were hospitalized, with 91% of hospitalizations occurring among persons with neuroinvasive disease. The median length of hospitalization for persons with neuroinvasive disease was 7 days (IQR = 4–11 days), compared with 4 days (IQR = 2–6 days) for those with nonneuroinvasive disease. During the investigation, cross-reactivity with mumps IgM testing was reported for 11 cases. MCDPH clinical staff members reviewed patient clinical courses, including symptoms, comorbidities, and potential exposures to determine compatibility with WNV and mumps; all patients’ clinical illnesses were considered to be more consistent with WNV than with mumps.

Public Health Response
After identification of the first confirmed human case during the 2021 WNV transmission season, MCDPH issued a SurvAlert on June 25, advising health care providers to consider WNV and other arboviruses in patients with clinical signs or symptoms compatible with WNV neuroinvasive disease.§§ MCDPH also alerted local blood banks to trigger individual donor screening rather than pooled screening. MCESD-VCD continued applying pesticide and larvicides, conducting mosquito surveillance, and responding to resident complaints of large quantities of mosquitoes or unmaintained swimming pools. In August, in anticipation of an increase in mosquitos during the Arizona monsoon season (June 15–September 30),¶¶ MCDPH increased social media messaging regarding mosquito breeding and WNV prevention strategies after each rain. In September, MCDPH added the local social networking service for neighborhoods, Nextdoor.com, to their social media outreach targeting populations at higher risk. ADHS worked with community partners, including the Arizona office of AARP and the Arizona Geriatric Society, to prioritize outreach to persons aged ≥60 years, who are at increased risk for WNV-associated morbidity and mortality (3).
On September 1, MCDPH issued a press release regarding the first death in a patient with confirmed WNV. Based on the substantially elevated VI, MCESD-VCD, MCDPH, and ADHS coordinated an enhanced response including distribution of insect repellent and information packets and participated in interviews across multiple media platforms to increase public awareness. ADHS also issued a HAN notifying providers of the record-breaking season. On October 13, MCDPH, MCESD-VCD, ADHS, and CDC met to discuss outbreak response strategies, including issuing a SurvAlert reiterating the unprecedented number of WNV cases and recommending that providers test the serum and CSF of patients being evaluated for suspected WNV. Throughout the 2021 season, MCESD-VC fogged >400,000 acres with adulticide (twice the 10-year per-acre average), applied larvicide to approximately 25,000 sites, and received approximately 9,500 mosquito abundance or green pool complaints (40% more than average).

Discussion
The largest recorded WNV outbreak in a U.S. county occurred during May–December 2021 in Maricopa County, Arizona, and included more than four times the number of cases reported (355) in the previous largest outbreak in the county during 2004 (8). The reason for the unprecedented 2021 WNV outbreak is unknown, but is likely multifactorial, potentially related to increased rain (9), recent population growth and housing development, and changes in health care-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this large number of human cases, local and state public health and vector agencies worked together to increase public and health care provider awareness, reinforce prevention messaging, and expand vector control activities.
The majority of identified cases resulted in neuroinvasive disease and occurred among older adults (aged ≥60 years). More than 1,000 patients required hospitalization, taxing a health care system that was already stressed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although COVID-19 cases exceeded WNV cases in Maricopa County (19,656 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized during May–December 2021) (8), health care facilities anecdotally reported intensive care units at full capacity with approximately one half of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and one half with WNV.
In spite of increased community and health care partner outreach through social and other media and health care provider messaging, anecdotally, clinicians and patients reported a lack of awareness of the WNV outbreak, highlighting the need for a more effective messaging strategy to increase public and provider awareness, case diagnosis, and WNV prevention. Based on provider reports, public health reminders to clinicians to consider WNV testing of both serum and CSF for ill patients are needed, especially among those patients with possible neuroinvasive disease. In addition, providers should be aware of potential cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses (e.g., St. Louis encephalitis and dengue) and potential false-positive results of the mumps IgM test; this has not been described previously and requires further evaluation.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, most cases identified were neuroinvasive disease, suggesting underrecognition of nonneuroinvasive disease, either because of mild illness, consideration of alternative etiologies (e.g., COVID-19), or low provider awareness about WNV. Previous estimates indicate that approximately 30–70 nonneuroinvasive cases occur for every neuroinvasive case identified (10); thus, surveillance data likely underestimate the true magnitude of this outbreak. Second, it was not possible to determine receipt of public messaging to ensure outreach to all areas of the county. Health education messaging materials developed for previous WNV outbreaks might be outdated; local, state, and federal agencies are currently partnering to update media campaigns. Finally, delays in laboratory testing affected timeliness of case investigation and implementation of prevention measures, slowed identification of response thresholds, and delayed the public health response.
WNV continues to cause serious illness and affects health care capacity, especially when outbreaks co-occur with other diseases, such as COVID-19. Increasing temperatures might extend the period during which mosquitos can multiply, potentially prolonging the WNV season in relation to the local environmental conditions (9). Analyses are underway to identify data thresholds for increased public and provider messaging on prevention, diagnosis, and testing. Timely and coordinated mosquito and human case surveillance are critical to identifying outbreaks and guiding prevention efforts.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Illicitly manufactured fentanyl was involved in 84% of 2,912 drug overdose deaths in Maryland during July 2020–June 2021.
What is added by this report?
Among 364 samples from drug paraphernalia collected at eight syringe services programs during November 2021–August 2022 that tested positive for fentanyl or fentanyl analogs, 80% also contained xylazine (an animal sedative). Heroin was rarely detected. Results were available within 48 hours. Sample test results did not always differ from participant expectations and were used to enhance harm reduction efforts.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Rapid analysis of drug paraphernalia can provide timely data on changing illicit drug markets that can be used to mitigate the harms of drug use more effectively.

A record number of 2,912 drug overdose deaths occurred in Maryland during the 12-month period July 1, 2020–June 30, 2021. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, or both* were involved in 84% of these deaths.† Timely identification of illicit drug market changes (e.g., fentanyl rapidly replacing heroin) could improve the public health response, specifically communications about risks for novel psychoactive substances. During November 19, 2021–August 31, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)§ tested 496 deidentified drug paraphernalia samples that staff members collected at eight Maryland syringe services programs (SSPs), also known as needle exchange programs,¶ in partnership with the Maryland Department of Health Center for Harm Reduction Services (CHRS).** All test results were available within 48 hours. Among the 496 paraphernalia samples collected, 367 (74.0%) tested positive for an opioid, and 364 (99.2%) of these samples contained fentanyl or fentanyl analogs. Approximately four fifths of fentanyl-positive samples also tested positive for the veterinary medicine xylazine, a sedative that when combined with opioids might increase the potential for fatal respiratory depression and soft tissue infections when injected (1). For 248 of the 496 samples, SSP participants also completed a questionnaire about the drugs they had intended to purchase. Among the 212 participants who had intended to buy an opioid, 87.7% were exposed to fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, or both, and 85.8% were unknowingly exposed to xylazine. Results improved awareness of fentanyl and xylazine among SSP staff members and galvanized efforts to enhance SSPs’ wound care services for participants experiencing soft tissue injuries possibly associated with injecting xylazine. Rapid analysis of drug paraphernalia can provide timely data on changing illicit drug markets that can be used to mitigate the harms of drug use more effectively.
In June 2021, CHRS, which oversees SSPs in Maryland, and NIST implemented the Rapid Analysis of Drugs (RAD) program to address the need for rapid, comprehensive, and reliable identification of illicit drugs. Twelve pilot sites were selected based on each site’s capacity and proximity to drug trafficking routes identified by law enforcement partners. In August 2021, eight of the 12 SSPs that were contacted agreed to participate.†† Staff members attended a virtual training covering RAD’s legal context and processes, including how to collect samples as safely as possible from used paraphernalia. Program staff members then sampled multiple types of drug paraphernalia, excluding syringes.
RAD involves a four-step process. First, wearing gloves, SSP staff members wipe or swab used drug paraphernalia received from registered SSP participants. Each individual wipe or swab is then placed into a small paper envelope that is collected in a larger mailing envelope (2). Program staff members administered a deidentified questionnaire simultaneously with paraphernalia sample collection and linked the questionnaire and sample with a unique barcode number.§§ Second, samples are mailed to NIST in accordance with U.S. Postal Service regulations. Third, samples are extracted and analyzed using direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS), a rapid ambient ionization mass spectrometry screening technique capable of analyzing a sample in seconds and detecting more than 1,100 drugs, cutting agents, and related substances¶¶ (3). Fourth, within 48 hours, NIST reports substances identified in each sample to CHRS and SSPs.*** SSPs are then responsible for sharing individual results back to the participant who submitted the sample. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†††
During November 19, 2021–August 31, 2022, staff members from eight SSPs asked program participants for permission to collect a sample from their used paraphernalia for drug testing and to complete a questionnaire about the drugs they had intended to purchase. A total of 496 paraphernalia samples were collected. For 248 (50.0%) of these samples, the program participant completed the questionnaire. No overdoses occurred on-site during sampling. The five most common types of paraphernalia tested, accounting for 95.7% of samples, were plastic bags (54.8%), cookers (16.3%), capsules (11.7%), vials (6.9%), and pipes or straws (6.0%). Among the 496 samples, one or more opioids were detected in 367 (74.0%) and cocaine in 77 (15.5%); none of the screened drugs were detected in 26 (5.2%) samples. Among the 367 opioid-positive samples, 363 (98.9%) contained fentanyl, 23 (6.3%) fluorofentanyl, and six (1.6%) fentanyl carbamate. One sample contained fluorofentanyl only; all other fentanyl analogs (e.g., fluorofentanyl and fentanyl carbamate) were also detected with fentanyl. Nonfentanyl opioids were detected infrequently: heroin (1.9%), tramadol (1.6%), methadone (0.5%), and protonitazene (0.3%). Among samples positive for fentanyl or a fentanyl analog (364), 84.4% had at least one other stimulant, sedative, or benzodiazepine detected: 293 (80.5%) had xylazine, 23 (6.3%) cocaine, 10 (2.7%) synthetic cathinones, six (1.6%) benzodiazepines, and three (0.8%) amphetamines (Figure).
Questionnaires were submitted for 248 (50.0%) samples.§§§ Among 212 respondents who reported opioid purchases,¶¶¶ 50.9% intended to purchase both heroin and fentanyl, or “fentanyl and/or heroin,”**** 46.7% sought fentanyl alone, and 2.4% sought heroin alone (Table). Eighty-one percent of samples matched the participant’s intentions but contained one or more additional substances, 13.2% did not include the substance the participant intended to purchase, and 5.7% matched participant intentions without other substances present. When the participant reported intent to buy heroin, no sample tested positive for heroin, and 1.9% of samples tested positive for heroin when the participant reported buying “fentanyl and heroin.” When participants reported intent to buy “fentanyl” or “fentanyl and heroin,” 97.0% and 79.6% of the samples, respectively, tested positive for fentanyl. When participants intended to buy “fentanyl” or “fentanyl and/or heroin,” xylazine was detected in 90.9% and 84.3% of samples, respectively. The questionnaire did not indicate xylazine in the list of drugs that participants might have intended to purchase; if they wanted to purchase xylazine, they would have needed to write it in an “other” drug category, and none of the participants did.

Discussion
RAD supported Maryland’s public health response to overdose deaths by quickly identifying the broad adulteration of fentanyl with xylazine and documenting the dominance of fentanyl (including samples mixed with fluorofentanyl) (4) and absence of heroin. Because of the success of the eight RAD pilot sites, CHRS expanded RAD to all Maryland SSPs during 2022; as of April 2023, 14 programs are participating.
Xylazine’s pervasiveness as an adulterant was unexpected by CHRS, program staff members, and participants, but aligned with observational evidence about an increase in injection-related wounds observed in other reports on xylazine (1). Wounds might appear outside the area of injection and might also occur when xylazine is smoked or snorted. Documenting the widespread adulteration of fentanyl with xylazine facilitated stronger communication about the risk for injection-related wounds with participants. CHRS is investing in wound care training and certification for nurses working in harm-reduction settings, creating standards of care for wound treatment in low-resourced settings, and pursuing quantitative data analysis opportunities to corroborate the relationship between statewide incidence of skin and soft tissue infections and the drug supply revealed through RAD.
Co-use of xylazine with fentanyl might increase the chance of fatal overdose.†††† The effects of xylazine are not reversed by naloxone and might require medical care; however, naloxone does reverse the effects of fentanyl and other opioids even when co-used with xylazine and should be administered for any suspected overdose (1,5). In response to these findings, CHRS and SPPs updated overdose response training to include managing xylazine-involved overdoses.
More than one half of questionnaire respondents intending to purchase opioids thought heroin might be present with fentanyl in the drugs they purchased, whereas heroin was present in fewer than 2% of samples. Because fentanyl is fast-acting and potent, it might lead to rapid onset of overdose (6). This finding reinforces the continued importance of fentanyl-specific overdose education efforts in Maryland. This instruction includes injecting slowly, not using drugs when alone, using fentanyl test strips, carrying naloxone, and seeking and accepting medical attention for an overdose.§§§§
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, drug paraphernalia were conveniently sampled from eight SSPs that primarily serve persons who use opioids and inject drugs; results are not necessarily generalizable to all persons using drugs or in other geographic regions. Second, syringes were not included in RAD because of sampling safety. Finally, DART-MS analysis is not quantitative, and substance purity was not measured.
Timely data about the illicit drug supply have been limited, retrospective, and often anecdotal. This report provides critical information on fentanyl and xylazine exposures among a population at high risk for overdose and related harm. In some areas, fentanyl is adulterated with emerging substances such as xylazine (7). Also, heroin-involved overdoses have substantially declined in some places as fentanyl-involved overdoses have become more dominant.¶¶¶¶ RAD can provide timely data on the rapid increase of common illicit drugs (e.g., fentanyl) as well as influx of emerging substances (e.g., xylazine) that can help harm reduction programs mitigate the health impact more effectively. This in turn might strengthen participants’ trust in SSPs, which might increase participants’ likelihood of seeking treatment and reducing their drug use (8). Providing persons who use drugs with timely data on the drugs they are using versus what they intended to use might also reduce public health harms (9,10).

* Fentanyl analogs, also known as fentanyl-related substances, vary in potency and are synthetic opioids similar in chemical structure to fentanyl but modified to produce distinct substances. Fentanyl analogs include acetyl fentanyl, acryl fentanyl, butyryl fentanyl, despropionyl fentanyl, and 4-fluorofentanyl.

†† The four SSPs that did not participate cited political pushback and insufficient capacity to implement RAD. Capacity issues included inadequate staffing and safety concerns about handling the paraphernalia on-site because SSPs typically only collect syringes for off-site disposal using biohazard containers that require no contact with staff members. As of January 10, 2023, Maryland had 22 active SSPs.
§§ Responses were documented into a webform accessible by CHRS staff members.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Waning of monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19–associated hospitalization among adults is recognized; however, little is known about the durability of protection provided by these vaccines against COVID-19–associated invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital death during the Omicron variant period.
What is added by this report?
Monovalent mRNA vaccination was 76% effective in preventing COVID-19–associated IMV and death <6 months after the last dose and remained 56% effective at 1–2 years.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines provided substantial, durable protection against COVID-19–associated IMV and death. All adults should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination to prevent critical outcomes of COVID-19.

As of April 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in 1.1 million deaths in the United States, with approximately 75% of deaths occurring among adults aged ≥65 years (1). Data on the durability of protection provided by monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination against critical outcomes of COVID-19 are limited beyond the Omicron BA.1 lineage period (December 26, 2021–March 26, 2022). In this case-control analysis, the effectiveness of 2–4 monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses was evaluated against COVID-19–associated invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital death among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years during February 1, 2022–January 31, 2023. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against IMV and in-hospital death was 62% among adults aged ≥18 years and 69% among those aged ≥65 years. When stratified by time since last dose, VE was 76% at 7–179 days, 54% at 180–364 days, and 56% at ≥365 days. Monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination provided substantial, durable protection against IMV and in-hospital death among adults during the Omicron variant period. All adults should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination to prevent critical COVID-19–associated outcomes.
Monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to prevent hospitalization and critical outcomes, including IMV and death, during SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Delta, and early Omicron variant periods (2,3). However, rapid waning of COVID-19 VE against infection, outpatient illness, and hospitalization has been observed during Omicron variant predominance (4). Understanding the durability of protection provided by monovalent mRNA vaccination against critical outcomes is vital. Although a bivalent mRNA dose was recommended on September 1, 2022, for all persons who had completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series, bivalent vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥18 years is 20%, and most adults have only received monovalent mRNA vaccines (1,5). In addition, COVID-19 VE against hospitalization might be artificially reduced by routine testing for SARS-CoV-2 at admission, which can detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients admitted for reasons other than COVID-19 (4,6,7). VE against critical outcomes might be less susceptible to this bias and is therefore needed to help guide COVID-19 vaccination policy regarding revaccination intervals.
Data from the Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY) Network§ were used to conduct a case-control analysis measuring the effectiveness of monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19–associated IMV and in-hospital death. During February 1, 2022–January 31, 2023, adults aged ≥18 years admitted to 24 hospitals in 19 U.S. states who met a COVID-19–like illness case definition¶ and received SARS-CoV-2 testing were enrolled. IVY Network methods have been described previously (2,3). Briefly, case-patients were defined as those who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen test result within 10 days of illness onset and within 3 days of hospital admission, and either received IMV or died in the hospital within 28 days of admission. Control patients were defined as those who received negative SARS-CoV-2 and influenza test results by RT-PCR within 10 days of illness onset and within 3 days of hospital admission. Patients who received positive influenza test results were excluded from the analysis because of potential correlation between COVID-19 and influenza vaccination behaviors (8).
Demographic and clinical data, including receipt of IMV and in-hospital death within 28 days of admission, were collected through electronic medical record (EMR) review and patient or proxy interview. COVID-19 vaccination history was ascertained from state or jurisdictional registries, EMRs, vaccination cards, and self-report. Patients were included in the analysis if they 1) received zero COVID-19 vaccines doses (unvaccinated) or 2) received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses (monovalent-vaccinated), with the last dose received ≥14 days before illness onset for a primary series dose or ≥7 days before illness onset for a booster dose. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they were immunocompromised,** received a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, received only 1 monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, received a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, or for other reasons†† that made the patient ineligible.
VE against IMV and in-hospital death was calculated using logistic regression, in which the odds of monovalent mRNA vaccination (versus being unvaccinated) were compared between COVID-19 case-patients and control patients. Logistic regression models were adjusted for U.S. Department of Health and Human Services region, calendar time in biweekly intervals, age, sex, and self-reported race and Hispanic ethnicity. VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted odds ratio) x 100%. Results were stratified by age group, time since receipt of last monovalent mRNA vaccine dose, and number of monovalent mRNA vaccine doses received.§§ Differences between VE point estimates with nonoverlapping 95% CIs were considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was determined to be public health surveillance by each participating site and CDC and was conducted in a manner consistent with all applicable federal laws and CDC policy.¶¶
During February 1, 2022–January 31, 2023, a total of 6,354 immunocompetent control patients and COVID-19 case-patients with IMV or in-hospital death were enrolled in the IVY Network. After exclusion of 1,933 patients,*** 4,421 (70%) were included in the analysis (362 case-patients and 4,059 control patients). Patients were most commonly excluded because of receipt of a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (446 [23% of excluded patients]), receipt of a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (392 [20%]), or receipt of only 1 monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (260 [13%]). Among included patients, the median age was 64 years (IQR = 53–75 years) (Table 1). Ninety-one percent of patients had one or more chronic condition, and 20% had a previous self-reported or documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 362 case-patients with IMV or in-hospital death, 146 (40%) were unvaccinated, 216 (60%) were monovalent-vaccinated, 293 (81%) received IMV, and 156 (43%) died in the hospital within 28 days of admission. Among 4,059 control patients, 979 (24%) were unvaccinated, and 3,080 (76%) were monovalent-vaccinated.
Among monovalent-vaccinated patients, the median interval from receipt of last dose to illness onset was 248 days (IQR = 138–378 days) (Table 2). When compared with unvaccinated patients, the VE of 2–4 monovalent mRNA vaccine doses against IMV and in-hospital death was 62%. VE was 57% among patients aged 18–64 years and 69% among patients aged ≥65 years. When stratified by interval since receipt of last monovalent dose, VE against IMV and in-hospital death was 76% at 7–179 days, 54% at 180–364 days, and 56% at ≥365 days. Within each interval since receipt of last monovalent dose, VE estimates did not differ significantly by number of doses received. VE point estimates were higher 7–179 days since last dose compared with ≥180 days since last dose, although 95% CIs overlapped.

Discussion
Among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years admitted to 24 hospitals in the IVY Network in 19 U.S. states, receipt of 2–4 monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses provided substantial protection against COVID-19–associated IMV and in-hospital death during the Omicron variant period. Protection was highest during the first 6 months after the last monovalent dose, with persistent residual protection remaining after 6 months and sustained at 1–2 years. Monovalent mRNA vaccination also provided substantial protection against COVID-19–associated IMV and death among adults aged ≥65 years, the age group that remains at highest risk of severe COVID-19 (1). These findings underscore the importance of staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination to prevent critical outcomes of COVID-19, including optional, additional bivalent mRNA booster doses for persons at highest risk of severe disease.†††
A previous analysis from the IVY Network showed high effectiveness of monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19–associated IMV and death during the Delta and early Omicron variant periods (2). The current analysis expands on these findings by reporting monovalent mRNA COVID-19 VE against IMV and in-hospital death for a full year during the Omicron variant period. These results suggest some waning of protection against IMV and death after 6 months from receipt of the last dose but demonstrate clinically meaningful levels of protection for ≥1 year (median = 455 days). In stratified analyses, VE appeared to correlate more closely with time since last dose than with total number of doses received. These findings are consistent with evidence from the United Kingdom showing that among adults aged ≥65 years, VE of monovalent COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19–associated mortality during the Omicron variant period was 49.7% for 2 doses and 56.9% for 3 doses after 40 weeks (280 days) from vaccination (9). Together, these results suggest maximal benefit of COVID-19 vaccination during the first 6 months after receipt, which should be considered along with trends in COVID-19 incidence and risk factors for severe disease when planning COVID-19 revaccination schedules.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the sample size was insufficient to generate VE estimates for each Omicron lineage period separately or to calculate some VE estimates stratified by both time since last monovalent mRNA dose and number of doses received. Second, although case-patients had evidence of acute respiratory illness and received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, inclusion of case-patients who died or required IMV for reasons other than COVID-19 could have reduced VE because of misclassification. Third, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was infrequently reported or documented among patients in this analysis, which prevented evaluation of the impact of previous infection on VE against critical outcomes. Finally, although VE estimates were adjusted for patient-level demographic characteristics, calendar time, and geographic region, residual confounding, including from COVID-19 antiviral treatment, cannot be excluded.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 1.1 million COVID-19–associated deaths have occurred in the United States, with the majority occurring among patients aged ≥65 years. Monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination provided substantial, durable protection against COVID-19–associated IMV and death during the Omicron variant period, including among older adults. Protection against these critical outcomes appeared to correlate more closely with time since last dose than with total number of doses received. On April 18, 2023, bivalent mRNA vaccines became the only mRNA COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States.§§§ Only 42% of adults aged ≥65 years have received a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose and are up to date with COVID-19 vaccination (1). CDC recommends that all adults remain up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including the updated bivalent vaccine, to prevent critical outcomes of COVID-19.

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) causes foodborne illness that can result in life-threatening kidney failure from hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). On August 9, 2022, the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) identified two cases of STEC infection in two infants aged 10 months who experienced diarrhea on July 25 and August 1. Stool specimens from both infants tested positive for STEC by polymerase chain reaction. One infant developed HUS requiring hemodialysis and hospitalization for 27 days. The second infant was hospitalized for 1 day and did not develop HUS. Both lived in households that consumed raw milk acquired from the same cow-share program, and at least one infant had reportedly consumed raw milk.*
To determine STEC source, TDH initiated an outbreak investigation, including a site visit to the cow-share dairy farm. Because the owner lived in a rural area without phone service or electricity, a TDH employee first visited the dairy farm to inform the owner of the investigation and collect a list of cow-share participants. On August 15, a site investigation and environmental assessment were conducted. The dairy farm included seven to 10 cows that were hand-milked daily. Observations identified possible routes of fecal contamination during milking and possible milk storage at temperatures higher than recommended, with cooling facilitated by mechanical circulation of cool spring water followed by immersion of milk containers in ice-filled coolers. Samples were taken from eight sites including a milk filter, a collection pail, barn posts, and four manure locations, as well as a sample of raw milk.
TDH conducted case finding among cow-share participants. The cow-share list included 125 participants from Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. TDH obtained telephone numbers for 109 participants and successfully reached 50 participants (40% of total) from households that included 112 persons. Three probable cases from a single household were identified based on exposure and self-described resolved clinical symptoms that began on July 20, without laboratory confirmation.† The two households with the two index cases in infants did not participate in the cow-share but obtained raw milk from participants. In total, five cases with two confirmed in hospitalized infants were identified; no deaths were reported.
The Tennessee Department of Health Laboratory Services (TDHLS) isolated STEC O157:H7 in the second index patient’s stool specimen. STEC was not isolated in the first index patient’s stool because of delayed specimen collection for testing by TDHLS. A U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory identified two isolates of STEC O157:H7 from a single cattle manure sample in the dairy farm’s milking barn. Whole genome sequencing conducted by TDHLS demonstrated that human and cattle stool isolates were highly related, with zero allele differences detected.§
In Tennessee, direct sale of raw milk is prohibited, and TDH advises against raw milk consumption; however, sharing of raw milk through cow-share arrangements is legally permitted.¶ Because the cow-share intends to continue raw milk distribution, TDH requested the University of Tennessee Extension’s Agriculture and Natural Resources Team visit the dairy farm on August 30 to provide education concerning best practices to reduce risk for milk contamination. Households participating in the cow-share were also mailed an educational letter about the risk for foodborne illness associated with raw milk.**
Raw milk consumption is associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases of foodborne illness (1,2). Children aged <5 years, adults aged ≥65 years, and persons with weakened immune systems are at greatest risk for severe illness. Although pasteurization reduces the risk of illness, raw milk regulation varies by state and point of sale.†† Environmental sampling is a useful tool for public health investigations; it permitted illness in this outbreak to be linked with STEC on the dairy farm. This outbreak highlights the risk for severe illness associated with cow-share arrangements, especially among young children, who are at increased risk for STEC-related HUS. The outbreak also demonstrated that households not formally participating in cow-share arrangements can be affected. Increasing awareness of inherent health risks of raw milk products in Tennessee could prevent further morbidity.

Monkeypox virus is an orthopoxvirus that can cause substantial morbidity due to skin and mucosal lesions (1). During the 2022 multinational Monkeypox (mpox) outbreak, tecovirimat, an antiviral medication approved for the treatment of smallpox, was used as an investigational treatment for severe mpox. However, efficacy and optimal treatment duration are still being investigated (1,2). In a late 2022 assessment of the use of tecovirimat for treatment of mpox under the expanded access Investigational New Drug protocol, three patients were found to have developed new lesions after completing treatment (3). This report describes a series of patients in New York City (NYC) with mpox who also developed new lesions after completing tecovirimat treatment, suggesting that posttreatment lesions might occur more commonly than previously reported.
A case of posttreatment mpox lesions was defined as the occurrence of new skin or mucosal lesions in an NYC resident with probable or confirmed mpox (4), emerging ≤30 days after completing the recommended 14-day tecovirimat treatment course, after improvement or resolution of initial mpox lesions. During August–September 2022, health care providers voluntarily reported 10 such cases to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Providers were asked to complete a survey detailing patient demographic and clinical characteristics and illness course. Descriptive analyses were performed on the nine surveys submitted.
The median patient age was 33 years (range = 23–46 years); eight were men, and one was a transgender woman (Table). Among eight patients with race reported, four were Black or African American, and four were White. Two patients reported Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. HIV status was known for all nine patients. Five had HIV, including four who were taking antiretrovirals at the time of mpox diagnosis (CD4 count >350 cells/mm3 and viral load <200 copies/mL), and one who was not taking antiretrovirals (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 and viral load unknown).
No patient received JYNNEOS vaccine* before experiencing mpox. Initial lesions tested positive for Orthopoxvirus using polymerase chain reaction testing. The median initial symptom severity score was 8 out of a possible 23 points (range = 6–13), assessed using the mpox severity score†. Six patients were tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at the time of mpox diagnosis; one received a positive gonorrhea test result and was treated.§
The median interval from mpox symptom onset to tecovirimat initiation was 9 days (range = 6–16 days). All patients received outpatient treatment from their health care provider with weight-appropriate oral dosing of tecovirimat, and all completed the recommended 14-day course with self-reported full adherence. No patient reported an adverse reaction, and providers assessed all patients’ mpox lesions as improved after treatment completion.
New lesions appeared a median of 13 days after completion of tecovirimat treatment (range = 2–30 days). In eight patients, posttreatment lesions were rated by the provider to be less severe than initial lesions (median severity score = 3 [range = 3–7]). Among six patients for whom orthopoxvirus testing of posttreatment lesions was conducted, one received a positive result. Two patients received repeat STI testing; one received a positive syphilis test result. The immunocompromised patient with untreated HIV received both the positive posttreatment orthopoxvirus and the positive syphilis test results.¶ Tecovirimat was restarted for two patients (one treated for 7 additional days and one treated for 14 additional days), both of whom had resolution of their lesions. Among the seven patients who did not receive a second course of tecovirimat, six had resolution of lesions, and one was lost to follow-up.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, because active surveillance for posttreatment lesions was not conducted, the number of cases reported here likely represents an underestimate of the actual prevalence. Second, not all posttreatment lesions were tested for Orthopoxvirus or other potential etiologies. Finally, analyses relied on provider-reported data, which can be subjective.
Further research is needed to understand the etiology of new lesions in patients with mpox after completion of tecovirimat therapy. One possibility is that Monkeypox virus, like other viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), can recur (5), but the recurrent viral load might be too low for test detection. Immunocompetent patients might not require additional tecovirimat, because most posttreatment lesions in this analysis resolved without further treatment. However, the clinical course in immunocompromised patients might be more complicated. The proportions of patients not tested for STIs, at initial mpox diagnosis and at the assessment of posttreatment lesions, represent missed opportunities to identify potential coinfections or alternative diagnoses.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Most pregnancy-related deaths due to mental health conditions, including substance use disorder–related overdose and poisoning, occur during the late (43–365-day) postpartum period.
What is added by this report?
In seven states with high opioid-involved overdose mortality rates, depressive symptoms, depression, anxiety, adverse childhood experiences, and stressful life events were associated with higher substance and polysubstance use prevalences among postpartum women. Postpartum substance use prevalence was most common among women experiencing six or more stressful life events in the year before giving birth (67.1%) or four household-dysfunction adverse childhood experiences (57.9%).
What are the implications for public health?
Clinical and community- and systems-level interventions can address postpartum substance use and mental health conditions and lessen harms associated with adverse childhood experiences.

Most pregnancy-related deaths due to mental health conditions, which include overdose and poisoning related to substance use disorder, occur during the late (43–365-day) postpartum period (1). Adverse childhood experiences and stressful life events are associated with increased substance use during pregnancy (2,3). Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) respondents in seven states with high opioid overdose mortality rates were recontacted 9–10 months after giving birth in 2019 and asked about postpartum prescription opioid misuse,* tobacco use, unhealthy alcohol use,† and use of other substances.§ Substance and polysubstance use prevalence estimates were calculated, stratified by mental health and social adversity indicators. Overall, 25.6% of respondents reported postpartum substance use, and 5.9% reported polysubstance use. The following conditions were associated with higher substance and polysubstance use prevalence in postpartum women: depressive symptoms, depression, anxiety, adverse childhood experiences, and stressful life events. Substance use prevalence was higher among women who experienced six or more stressful life events during the year preceding the birth (67.1%) or four adverse childhood experiences related to household dysfunction (57.9%). One in five respondents who experienced six or more stressful life events in the year before giving birth and 26.3% of women with four adverse childhood experiences reported postpartum polysubstance use. Clinical and community- and systems-level interventions to improve postpartum health can include screening and treatment for depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders during the postpartum period. Evidence-based strategies can prevent adverse childhood experiences and mitigate the immediate and long-term harms.¶
PRAMS is a collaboration between CDC and participating jurisdictions to conduct population-based surveillance for maternal experiences before, during, and after pregnancy among women with a recent live birth (4). To better understand opioid use and risks for opioid use among postpartum women, PRAMS recontacted respondents from 2019 in seven states with high rates of opioid-involved overdose deaths** 9–10 months after they gave birth. They were asked about use of opioid pain relievers since giving birth, including source and reasons for use, as well as use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances††; current depression or anxiety§§; and depressive symptoms during the previous 30 days.¶¶ Respondents were also asked whether they had experienced any of four household-dysfunction adverse childhood experiences before age 18 years.*** During the core PRAMS survey, respondents in six of the seven states were asked whether they had experienced any of 14 stressful life events during the year preceding the birth.†††
Postpartum substance use was defined as the misuse of opioid pain relievers, unhealthy alcohol use, or any use of tobacco or other substances since giving birth. Polysubstance use was defined as using two or more of these substances. Data were weighted to account for the PRAMS sample, nonresponse, and noncoverage. Estimates are representative of women with a live birth in each participating state during a 5-month period in 2019.§§§
Weighted prevalence and 95% CIs of postpartum substance and polysubstance use were estimated overall and by age, combined race and ethnicity, education level, health insurance status at the time of recontact, state of residence, previous 30-day depressive symptoms, current depression, current anxiety, number of adverse childhood experiences, and number of stressful life events. Chi-square tests with adjusted Wald F statistics were used to determine statistical significance of differences across characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, education level, health insurance status, and state of residence were used to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) of postpartum substance and polysubstance use for each mental health and social adversity indicator. Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0; RTI International). This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at CDC and each participating PRAMS site.¶¶¶
Among 1,990 respondents in seven states, 1,920 (96%) provided data on postpartum substance use. The weighted prevalences of postpartum substance use and polysubstance use were 25.6% and 5.9%, respectively. Substance use prevalence varied significantly across categories of education level, health insurance status, and state of residence. Significant differences in polysubstance use rates were observed by race and ethnicity and health insurance status (Table 1).
The prevalence of substance use was approximately twice as high among respondents who reported the following conditions than among those who didn’t: depressive symptoms (48.5% versus 24.0%), current depression (42.8% versus 21.9%), and anxiety (40.9% versus 18.9%) (Table 1). The prevalence of polysubstance use was also higher among respondents who reported those conditions than among those who did not: 17.5% versus 7.0%, 17.3% versus 3.5%, and 13.0% versus 2.8%, respectively.
Among respondents who reported all four household-dysfunction adverse childhood experiences, the prevalence of postpartum substance use was 57.9% and of polysubstance use was 26.3%. Among respondents reporting six or more stressful life events during the year before giving birth, the prevalence of postpartum substance use was 67.1% and of polysubstance use was 20.8%.
Adjusted prevalences of postpartum substance use and polysubstance use among respondents with depressive symptoms were 1.8 and 3.0 times as high, respectively, as among those without these symptoms. aPRs for the association of any postpartum substance and polysubstance use with current depression and anxiety were similar (Table 2). Prevalences of postpartum substance and polysubstance use among those reporting two to four adverse childhood experiences were 2.1 and 5.5 times as high, respectively, as among those reporting none. Compared with the prevalence of substance use among those who reported no stressful life events in the year before giving birth, prevalence of substance use was 3.6 times as high and of polysubstance use was 9.1 times as high among those who reported six or more stressful life events (Table 2).

Discussion
In a population-based sample of women from seven states with high rates of opioid overdose deaths who had participated in a PRAMS survey and were recontacted 9–10 months after a live birth in 2019, approximately one in four reported substance use, and more than one in 17 reported polysubstance use since giving birth. These results update postpartum polysubstance use estimates for the United States and demonstrate that polysubstance use commonly co-occurs during the postpartum period with mental health conditions and a history of predelivery life stressors and adverse childhood experiences. In the 2006–2014 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 5.1% of pregnant women and 24.3% of nonpregnant women reported using more than one substance during the previous month (5). In the 2009–2019 NSDUH, previous-month polysubstance use during pregnancy ranged from 31.3% in the first trimester to 7.8% in the third trimester (6). NSDUH and PRAMS use different sampling and administration methods as well as different definitions of alcohol use; therefore, direct comparisons between the two surveillance systems is difficult.
A history of stressful life events in the year before giving birth and adverse childhood experiences related to household dysfunction were both associated with a higher prevalence of postpartum substance use. This finding is consistent with studies of perinatal alcohol (2) and marijuana use (3). The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a comprehensive postpartum visit within 12 weeks of giving birth that includes 1) screening for depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder; 2) assessment of material needs such as housing, utilities, and food; and 3) referrals for follow-up care and resources (7,8). ACOG also emphasizes that postpartum care should be a process tailored to individual needs, coordinated between obstetric and primary care providers (7). The United States Preventive Services Task Force provides screening guidance for unhealthy substance use and depression, including for pregnant and postpartum women (9,10). Approaches to reduce postpartum harms of adverse childhood experiences include family-centered treatment approaches for substance-use disorders and victim-centered services.
Recommendations from Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC) investigations of pregnancy-related mental health and substance use–associated deaths highlight potential community- and systems-level interventions (1). To prevent maternal deaths, MMRC recommends improving social, family, and peer support and education for patients, providers, and communities (1). Other strategies to prevent, identify, and improve access to treatment of opioid use disorder among pregnant and postpartum women include sharing best practices through collaborative learning communities, and perinatal quality collaboratives supporting multidisciplinary teams to build capacity for screening, treating, and coordinating care for pregnant and postpartum women with opioid use disorder and their infants.****
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, these data are only generalizable to the seven states that administered the callback survey, where overdose mortality rates were high. Second, substance use was self-reported and is subject to social desirability bias and therefore might be underestimated. Third, misuse of prescription medications other than opioid pain relievers was not included in the definition of substance misuse. Fourth, information on adverse childhood experiences such as physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, or stressful life events after giving birth, was not collected. Finally, the definition of polysubstance use in this report represents use of two or more substances any time since giving birth and not necessarily that respondents used multiple substances at the same time.
Substance use was common in the postpartum period, particularly among those women who reported experiencing social adversity. Comprehensive prenatal and postpartum care, including screening and treatment for mental health and substance use disorders and community support and education, might help address postpartum substance use–related morbidity and mortality.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Non-Hispanic Asian and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) persons represent a growing segment of the U.S. population, and are often aggregated in analyses.
What is added by this report?
Cancer incidence among 25 Asian and NHPI subgroups differed by sex, age, cancer type, and stage at diagnosis. For example, lung cancer was the most common cancer among Chamoru, Micronesian, and Vietnamese persons; colorectal cancer was the most common cancer among Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Papua New Guinean persons.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Understanding cancer distribution among Asian and NHPI subgroups might help guide development and implementation of culturally and linguistically relevant programs addressing health disparities and social determinants of health.

Non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) persons represent growing segments of the U.S. population (1). Epidemiologic cancer studies often aggregate Asian and NHPI persons (2,3); however, because Asian and NHPI persons are culturally, geographically, and linguistically diverse (2,4), subgroup analyses might provide insights into the distribution of health outcomes. To examine the frequency and percentage of new cancer cases among 25 Asian and NHPI subgroups, CDC analyzed the most current 2015–2019 U.S. Cancer Statistics data.* The distribution of new cancer cases among Asian and NHPI subgroups differed by sex, age, cancer type, and stage at diagnosis (for screening-detected cancers). The percentage of cases diagnosed among females ranged from 47.1% to 68.2% and among persons aged <40 years, ranged from 3.1% to 20.2%. Among the 25 subgroups, the most common cancer type varied. For example, although breast cancer was the most common in 18 subgroups, lung cancer was the most common cancer among Chamoru, Micronesian race not otherwise specified (NOS), and Vietnamese persons; colorectal cancer was the most common cancer among Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Papua New Guinean persons. The frequency of late-stage cancer diagnoses among all subgroups ranged from 25.7% to 40.3% (breast), 38.1% to 61.1% (cervical), 52.4% to 64.7% (colorectal), and 70.0% to 78.5% (lung). Subgroup data illustrate health disparities among Asian and NHPI persons, which might be reduced through the design and implementation of culturally and linguistically responsive cancer prevention and control programs, including programs that address social determinants of health.
Invasive cancer cases were defined according to the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition† diagnosed during 2015–2019 using the most current U.S. Cancer Statistics data. This source of high-quality incidence data from population-based cancer registries, supported by CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, covers approximately 99% of the U.S. population during the 5-year period.
Central cancer registries collect race and ethnicity information from different sources, including self-reported intake questionnaires, abstracted patient records, electronic health records, linkages to administrative databases, and algorithms to impute missing data (5). The current analysis is restricted to Asian and NHPI persons who reported non-Hispanic ethnicity. Race was recorded by standardized coding methods using 30 race groups, including 25 Asian and NHPI subgroups.§ Some subgroups were defined by region rather than race (e.g., Micronesian race NOS). Because of low case counts, in some analyses, Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Thai persons were aggregated into an Other Southeast Asian group.¶ Data for other racial groups are available in the Data Visualizations Tool** (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126010). Cases were stratified by race, sex, and age for all cancers combined and then categorized into the 10 most common cancer types among all Asian and NHPI persons. A subset of cancer types detectable by screening†† (i.e., female breast, colon and rectum, lung and bronchus, and cervix uteri) were further categorized by stage at diagnosis as early-stage, late-stage, or unknown.§§ Because current national population denominators are not available for all subgroups, results are presented as frequencies and percentages rather than rates. In all analyses, cells containing fewer than six cases were suppressed to protect confidentiality and reduce misinterpretation or misuse of unstable counts. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶
During 2015–2019, a total of 273,656 new invasive cancer cases were reported among Asian persons and 18,491 among NHPI persons in the United States (Table 1); these included 92,562 in East Asian persons (31.7% of all cases among Asian and NHPI persons), 71,721 in Southeast Asian persons (24.5%), 44,890 in South Asian persons (15.4%), and 64,483 in Other Asian persons (22.1%). Approximately one half of cases among Asian (56.2%) and NHPI (56.5%) persons were diagnosed in females, and approximately one tenth were diagnosed in persons aged <40 years (including 8.5% in Asian and 9.6% in NHPI persons). Across subgroups, the highest percentages of new cancer cases among females occurred among Tahitian (68.2%), Thai (65.5%), and Fiji Islander (65.1%) subgroups. The percentage of new cancer cases in persons aged <40 years was highest among Hmong (20.2%), Micronesian race NOS (18.1%), and Melanesian race NOS persons (15.7%), and lowest among Japanese persons (3.1%).
Breast cancer accounted for the highest proportion of new cancer diagnoses among 18 (72.0%) of the 25 Asian and NHPI subgroups. Lung cancer was the most common cancer among Chamoru, Micronesian race NOS, and Vietnamese persons; colorectal cancer was the most common cancer among Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Papua New Guinean persons (Table 2) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126010).
Among Asian and NHPI subgroups, the frequency of late-stage diagnoses for screening-detected cancers ranged from 25.7% (Japanese) to 40.2% (Other Southeast Asian) and 40.3% (Pacific Islander) for breast cancer; from 38.1% (Other Asian) to 61.1% (Korean) for cervical cancer; from 52.4% (Other Asian) to 64.7% (Other Southeast Asian) for colorectal cancer; and from 70.0% (Other Asian) to 78.5% (Other Southeast Asian) for lung cancer (Table 3).

Discussion
Persons of Asian and NHPI origin are often aggregated into one racial group (2,3); however, the findings in this report show differences in cancer distribution and late-stage cancer diagnoses among Asian and NHPI subgroups. These results are generally consistent with a study that found a higher percentage of distant-stage colorectal cancers among men with an origin in Cambodia, Laos, or Vietnam (6). Late-stage cancer cases can be attributed in part to disparities in cancer screening (7). National Health Interview Survey data from 2018 show that Asian American persons were less likely than non-Hispanic White or non-Hispanic Black or African American persons to be up to date with colorectal cancer testing, pap smear, or mammogram (7,8). One way CDC addresses cancer disparities is with the development of resources such as the Breast Cancer Disparities Tool Kit.*** Although this online tool is not tailored to specific populations, it encourages coordinated partner engagement, sustainable implementation from trusted messengers, and evaluation to address social determinants of health and reduce mortality among groups that experience breast cancer disparities.
Ongoing surveillance is important in addressing and evaluating cancer disparities among different populations. An evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on the number of breast and cervical cancer screening tests provided through CDC’s National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program found that in April 2020, breast cancer screening among Asian and NHPI women declined 97% compared with the previous 5-year average; cervical cancer screening decreased by 92% (8). To help address the decline in screening among certain populations, CDC has partnered with health care providers to resume timely use of preventive tests such as cancer screening (8). Cancer screening tests can aid in the early detection of breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers, when treatment is likely to be most effective (8).
A better understanding of cancer distribution among Asian and NHPI persons can support the development of tailored cancer prevention and control initiatives. For example, in response to studies that found high rates of liver cancer among Asian and NHPI persons combined (9), the Hawaii Comprehensive Cancer Coalition developed a culturally and linguistically appropriate statewide hepatitis B vaccination media campaign††† for non–U.S.-born Asian and NHPI persons. The Massachusetts Comprehensive Cancer Steering Committee is working to increase breast cancer screening rates among Asian women by collaborating with advocacy and state outreach partners.§§§ Culturally and linguistically competent programs might help address disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes; such programs are particularly well-positioned to succeed when they consider social determinants of health (i.e., social and environmental circumstances in which persons live, learn, work, and play¶¶¶) (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, current national population denominators were not available for all subgroups; therefore, comparing rates was not possible. Second, because of small case counts among certain subgroups, comparisons between certain subgroups were limited. Third, multiracial identification was not included in this analysis. Finally, other risk factors not routinely collected by cancer registries could not be assessed.
Differences in cancer distribution among Asian and NHPI subgroups exist. Using population-based cancer registries to identify groups with disproportionate cancer outcomes might help guide the design and implementation of cancer prevention and control programs that consider social determinants of health. CDC funds several national cancer programs that are required to include activities to identify and address drivers of cancer health disparities.****

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (1). As strategies to mitigate the pandemic were implemented, concerns were raised that the containment efforts through quarantine and social distancing practices were negatively affecting the mental and physical health of children and adolescents (2). Suicide is a growing public health problem in the United States. In 2020, suicide was the second leading cause of death among persons aged 10–14 years and the third leading cause among those aged 15–24 years (3). The National Poison Data System (NPDS) database was used to examine trends in suspected suicide attempts by self-poisoning among persons aged 10–19 years before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with 2019 (prepandemic), during 2021, the overall rate of suspected suicide attempts by self-poisoning increased by 30.0% (95% CI = 28.6%–30.9%), rates among children aged 10–12 years, adolescents aged 13–15 years, and females increased 73.0% (67.4%–80.0%), 48.8% (46.7%–50.9%), and 36.8% (35.4%–38.2%), respectively, and these trends continued into the third quarter of 2022. Substances most frequently involved in overdoses were acetaminophen, ibuprofen, sertraline, fluoxetine, and diphenhydramine. Acetaminophen-involved overdoses increased 71% (67.4%–74.9%) in 2021 and 58.0% (54.5%–61.6%) in 2022. Diphenhydramine-involved overdoses increased 24.2% (19.9%–28.7%) in 2021 and 35.8% (31.2%–40.5%) in 2022. A comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention, focused on children and adolescents and involving a partnership between families, school teachers, mental health professionals, and public health leadership is needed. The 9-8-8 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides crisis support for persons experiencing mental health–related distress and assists community members who are concerned about persons experiencing a mental health crisis.*
A retrospective review of the NPDS database, the data warehouse for all 55 U.S. poison control centers (PCCs), during January 1, 2016–September 30, 2022, was conducted. Each PCC submits, in near real-time, deidentified case data to NPDS after providing necessary poison exposure management and information services to callers from the general public and health care providers. Closed cases coded by specialists in poison information as intentional suspected suicide involving persons aged 10–19 years were included. The NPDS coding manual specifies that cases coded as intentional suspected suicide include suspected suicide attempts as well as intentional self-harm cases. Multiple substances (multiple exposures) can be reported for each call. Cases classified as a confirmed nonexposure (reliable and objective evidence that exposure to a pharmaceutical or nonpharmaceutical agent never occurred) and those involving persons of unknown age were excluded. Reported numeric age was used to manually compute three age group categories (10–12, 13–15, and 16–19 years). Trends in the frequency and rates of suspected suicide attempts by self-poisoning (suspected suicide attempts per 100,000 persons aged 10–19 years) (4) were analyzed using Poisson regression methods and stratified by age group, sex, source of calls made to PCCs, level of care, substance involved, and clinical outcome. To assess the potential impact of the pandemic, yearly changes in suspected suicide attempt rates were compared between 2016 and 2022. The year 2019, the last calendar year before the pandemic, was considered the reference year. Monthly trends in suspected suicide attempt calls were plotted for January 2019–September 2022. Monthly counts of suspected suicide attempts and overall human exposure calls† during the pandemic were compared with their corresponding 2019 reference months. Interpretation of trends in suspected suicide attempts considered the potential impact of changes in the monthly overall human exposure calls to PCCs. Data were analyzed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Percent changes are reported with the corresponding 95% CIs. The study was conducted on deidentified NPDS data and was exempt from comprehensive Institutional Review Board review.
The yearly trend of suspected suicide attempt rates showed a sharp increase in 2021 compared with previous years. From 2019 to 2021, the overall number of human exposure calls to PCCs decreased 3.1%, from 2,148,141 to 2,080,917 (p<0.001); however, suspected suicide attempt calls increased (29.5%) in 2021 compared with prepandemic rates (2019). Calls to PCCs regarding suspected suicide attempts increased for both males and females (except between 2018 and 2019) and across all age groups (Table). In 2021, a statistically significant increase in the rate of suspected suicide attempts occurred among children aged 10–12 years (73.0%), adolescents aged 13–15 years (48.8%), and females (36.8%); this increase continued into September 2022. Call rates made to PCCs from health care facilities (29.0%) and the general public (33.0%) increased during 2021 as did admissions to psychiatric facilities (29.3%).
In 2021 and 2022, an analysis of substances involved in suspected suicide attempts found acetaminophen, ibuprofen, sertraline, fluoxetine, and diphenhydramine to be the substances most frequently involved, with a significant increase in acetaminophen- (71.0% and 58.0%, respectively) and diphenhydramine- (24.2% and 35.8%, respectively) involved overdoses compared with those in 2019. Overdoses involving ibuprofen (35.1%), fluoxetine (44.2%), and sertraline (32.3%) increased significantly in 2021 compared with prepandemic rates (2019) (Figure 1). Single-substance cases accounted for 430,051 (68%) suspected suicide attempt calls; acetaminophen (excluding combinations with other substances) was the most frequent single substance involved in suspected suicide attempts, accounting for 57,768 (13.4%) of single-substance cases.
The monthly variation in suspected suicide attempt–related calls among persons aged 10–19 years increased during school months, with a sharp increase in September, and a decline during summer months (June and July) and winter breaks (December) (Figure 2). During the period when the national lockdown was implemented (April–May 2020), suspected suicide attempt–related calls were lower compared with those during the same months in 2019, 2021, and 2022 (p<0.001); the overall human exposure calls did not decrease during this same period. However, during June 2020–February 2022, monthly suspected suicide attempt–related calls were significantly higher than they were during the corresponding months of 2019 (with the exception of March–June 2020, when suspected suicide attempt–related calls were similar to those in 2019). The monthly overall human exposure calls to PCCs significantly declined beginning in August 2020 compared with the corresponding months during 2019 (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126401).

Discussion
This study, examining the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suspected suicide attempts by self-poisoning among children and adolescents using a U.S. national database, found an increase during the pandemic, most notably among children aged 10–12 years, adolescents aged 13–15 years, and females, with the sharpest increase in attempts involving acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Further, the study revealed an increase in admissions to psychiatric facilities. These findings suggest that the mental health of children and adolescents was affected by the pandemic, raising concerns about long-term consequences, especially given that previous attempted suicide has been found to be the strongest predictor of subsequent death by suicide (5). The results support findings of an increase in emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts among persons aged 12–17 years, particularly among adolescent girls, beginning in mid-2020, reported in mid-2021, based on data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (6). An increase in the proportion of suspected suicide-related calls during 2015–2020, involving acetaminophen and ibuprofen, among children aged 10–12 years, was recently reported, in an analysis of calls to PCCs using NPDS data (7). The current findings revealed an increase in rates of suspected suicide attempts involving acetaminophen and ibuprofen among U.S. population aged 10–12 years during 2016–2022; however, the increase during the pandemic was at an accelerated rate.
The period coinciding with the beginning of the pandemic and stay-at-home orders (March 2020) was characterized by an initial decrease in reported cases of suspected attempted suicide, followed by a subsequent increase (July 2020). A similar trend in suicides is commonly seen among persons affected by crises such as natural disasters and wars. This phenomenon is frequently termed the “honeymoon effect” (8). The seasonality of suicide among children and adolescents is reported in the literature and is characterized by a significant decline during the months of June, July, and August, as well as December (9). The seasonality of suspected suicide attempts among youth during the pandemic can be observed starting in September 2020.
In the current study, rates of acetaminophen-involved suicide attempts in 2020 surpassed those of ibuprofen that had predominated in earlier years and continued to increase through September 2022. Three of the top five most frequently identified drugs involved in suspected suicide attempts in this analysis are over-the-counter medications, and two drugs are antidepressant medications. An urgent need exists to strengthen programs focused on identifying and supporting persons at risk for suicide, especially young persons. In addition, protective environments need to be created through the reduction of access to lethal means including promoting the safe storage of medications (e.g., over-the-counter drugs).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, NPDS data are not designed to assess potential risk factors leading to increases in suspected suicide attempts. However, visits to an emergency department for mental health consults and suspected child abuse, risk factor for potential suicide attempts, also increased in 2020 compared with 2019 (10). Further, call volume to PCCs decreased during the pandemic; therefore, the increase in calls for suspected suicide attempts cannot be explained by the change in call volume. In addition, although the U.S. population aged 10–19 years decreased 0.4% from 42,314,777 in 2019 to 42,190,515 in 2021 (4), this decrease cannot fully account for the increase in rates of suspected suicide attempts during the pandemic. Second, because NPDS data are affected by completeness of reporting from health care providers and the general public, as well as the accuracy of data entry and coding by PCC staff members, they are susceptible to reporting bias. Third, multiple substances can be reported for each call to PCCs, and it was not possible to determine which substance was most related to the clinical effects and medical outcome. Finally, because reporting to PCCs is voluntary, NPDS data do not represent all cases of suspected suicide attempts. However, the consistency of these findings with those in other published studies highlights the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with harmful effects on youth mental health and underscores the need for further research to confirm these findings and inform prevention strategies (6,10).
Pediatric and adolescent suicide attempts by self-poisoning have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative to mitigate this increase with suicide prevention measures that focus on children and adolescents and involve partnerships between key partners in the communities, such as families, school teachers, mental health professionals, and public health leadership. Suicide prevention resources and tools are available to help communities prevent suicide. These strategies include identifying and supporting youth at risk for suicide, creating protective environments through reduction of access to lethal means, improving access to mental health care, and teaching coping and problem-solving skills. In addition, the 9-8-8 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline became available nationally in July 2022. The 9-8-8 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is a national network of more than 200 crisis centers supported by local and state sources as well as the Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. During 1999–2019, non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) adults experienced consistently higher stroke death rates than did non-Hispanic White (White) adults.
What is added by this report?
During the COVID-19 pandemic, age-adjusted stroke mortality rates increased among both Black and White adults; however, the absolute difference between Black and White adults was 21.7% higher than during the prepandemic period. The percentage of excess stroke deaths during the pandemic was higher among Black (9.4%) than among White (6.9%) adults.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Identifying the health care, behavioral, and contextual factors associated with these widened disparities and providing tailored interventions are necessary to reduce disparities in stroke mortality among Black and White adults.

Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States (1). Although stroke death rates have declined since the 1950s, age-adjusted rates remained higher among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) adults than among non-Hispanic White (White) adults (1,2). Despite intervention efforts to reduce racial disparities in stroke prevention and treatment through reducing stroke risk factors, increasing awareness of stroke symptoms, and improving access to treatment and care for stroke (1,3), Black adults were 45% more likely than were White adults to die from stroke in 2018.* In 2019, age-adjusted stroke death rates (AASDRs) (stroke deaths per 100,000 population) were 101.6 among Black adults and 69.1 among White adults aged ≥35 years. Stroke deaths increased during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (March–August 2020), and minority populations experienced a disproportionate increase (4). The current study examined disparities in stroke mortality between Black and White adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts used National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) mortality data accessed via CDC WONDER† to calculate AASDRs among Black and White adults aged ≥35 years prepandemic (2015–2019) and during the pandemic (2020–2021). Compared with that during the prepandemic period, the absolute difference in AASDR between Black and White adults during the pandemic was 21.7% higher (31.3 per 100,000 versus 38.0). During the pandemic period, an estimated 3,835 excess stroke deaths occurred among Black adults (9.4% more than expected) and 15,125 among White adults (6.9% more than expected). These findings underscore the importance of identifying the major factors contributing to the widened disparities; implementing prevention efforts, including the management and control of hypertension, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes; and developing tailored interventions to reduce disparities and advance health equity in stroke mortality between Black and White adults. Stroke is a serious medical condition that requires emergency care. Warning signs of a stroke include sudden face drooping, arm weakness, and speech difficulty. Immediate notification of Emergency Medical Services by calling 9-1-1 is critical upon recognition of stroke signs and symptoms.
Annual AASDRs (calculated using 2000 U.S. Census Bureau standard population) and 95% CIs for Black and White adults aged ≥35 years were calculated for 2015–2020 (using final underlying cause of death data stratified by bridged-race categories) and 2021 (using underlying cause of death data stratified by single-race categories as of March 20, 2023) using CDC WONDER mortality data based on place of residence data from death certificates filed in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. AASDRs and 95% CIs were then calculated for the prepandemic and pandemic periods. International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision cause of death codes I60–I69 (cerebrovascular disease) were used to classify stroke as the underlying cause of death. This study included persons listed as having one race (Black or White) and non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.§ Disparities between Black and White adults were measured using absolute and relative differences. The absolute difference in AASDR among adults aged ≥35 years (rate among Black adults minus rate among White adults) was calculated for the prepandemic and pandemic periods and compared. The relative difference was measured by rate ratios calculated as AASDR among Black adults divided by AASDR among White adults. The 95% CIs for the absolute and relative differences were estimated. Nonoverlapping 95% CIs for rates, absolute differences, or relative differences between two periods or two groups (e.g., women versus men) were considered statistically significant. Analyses were stratified by sex and age group (35–64, 65–84, and ≥85 years).
Excess stroke deaths for Black and White adults during the pandemic were estimated as follows: 1) annual percent changes (APC) in the sex-, age-, and race and ethnicity–specific stroke death rates during 2015–2019 were estimated; 2) expected rates for 2020 and 2021 were calculated, assuming the APC during 2015–2019 would continue during 2020–2021; 3) the expected number of stroke deaths was obtained by multiplying the sex-, age-, and race and ethnicity–specific population by the expected stroke death rates; and 4) excess stroke deaths were calculated as the number of stroke deaths observed minus the number expected¶ (5). Analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and Joinpoint (version 4.8.1.0; National Cancer Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**
During 2015–2019, AASDR remained consistent for both Black (range = 100.5–102.0 [with a slight trend of increased rates]) and White adults (range = 69.1–70.6 [with a slight trend of decreased rates]); the average absolute difference was 31.3 per 100,000, and the average relative difference was 1.4. The relative differences in stroke mortality between Black and White adults were higher among men than women, and decreased with increasing age (Table 1) (Figure). During the COVID-19 pandemic, AASDR increased among both populations, but the increase was larger among Black adults; the average AASDR among Black adults increased 11.2% (from 101.3 to 112.6), compared with 6.6% (from 70.0 to 74.6) among White adults. The absolute difference in AASDR between Black and White adults increased 21.7% (from 31.3 to 38.0), and the average relative difference increased to 1.5. The patterns of increased disparities in stroke mortality, as measured by percent change in absolute differences, during the pandemic were similar among men and women and increased with increasing age. The absolute difference in AASDR between Black and White adults increased 10.9% (from 16.6 to 18.4) among persons aged 35–64 years and 19.4% (from 89.8 to 107.2) among persons aged 65–84 years. During the prepandemic period, annual stroke mortality rates among persons aged ≥85 years were lower among Black than among White adults (2). The absolute difference in this age group changed from −23.7 during 2015–2019 to 30.3 per 100,000 during 2020–2021 (Table 1). During 2020–2021, an estimated 3,835 excess stroke deaths occurred among Black adults (9.4% more than expected), and 15,125 excess stroke deaths occurred among White adults (6.9% more than expected). The estimated percentage of excess stroke deaths among both Black and White adults was higher among women and decreased with increasing age (Table 2).

Discussion
This analysis found that in the United States, disparities among Black and White adults in stroke mortality widened from the prepandemic period to the pandemic period. Although stroke mortality increased among both Black and White adults, the absolute difference in AASDRs between the groups increased an estimated 21.7%; this pattern was similar in men and women. The estimated percentage of excess stroke deaths during the pandemic period among Black adults (9.4%) was higher than that among White adults (6.9%). The disparity, measured by absolute difference in AASDR, among adults aged 35–54 years increased approximately 11%, and among adults aged 65–84 years, increased 19%; the lower stroke mortality among Black adults aged ≥85 years during the prepandemic period reversed during the pandemic period.
Disparities in stroke mortality among Black and White adults are largely driven by differences in stroke incidence, with higher prevalences of high blood pressure and diabetes being the major risk factors for stroke among Black adults (1,2,6); racial differences in case-fatality played a minor role (2,6). The COVID-19 pandemic caused a substantial shift in health care for patients with high blood pressure and might have exacerbated existing inequities in high blood pressure treatment and control among persons of color (7). Reduced emergency department visits and hospitalizations for stroke, partly because of fear of SARS-CoV-2 infections (especially during the early phase of the pandemic) (8), suggest that delayed stroke treatment and care might have resulted in worse stroke outcomes and increased risk for death. Further, health and lifestyle behaviors, such as mental health, physical activity, and diet and sleep quality were adversely affected by the pandemic and might have disproportionately affected persons of color, resulting in increased risk for stroke (4). COVID-19 is associated with increased risk for stroke (9); disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 experienced by Black persons†† (10) might have contributed to the widened disparity among Black and White adults in stroke mortality.
A main goal of the Healthy People 2030 initiative is to improve the health and well-being of all U.S. persons by eliminating health disparities, achieving health equity, and increasing health literacy.§§ Further studies are needed to identify and evaluate the underlying risk factors, including stress-related factors such as economic strain, poor mental health, and social determinants of health that might have contributed to the widened disparity between Black and White adults in stroke mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tailored interventions to improve the prevention, control and management of risk factors, system-based stroke care, and structural changes addressing racial disparities in health care might be required to effect lasting change.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the NVSS mortality data lacks information to determine how much of an increase in stroke mortality was directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, this study focused on disparity in stroke mortality among Black and White adults before and during the pandemic, and did not include other races.
Substantial disparities in stroke mortality between Black and White adults in the United States exist and have widened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic imposed setbacks to progress made in reducing disparities in stroke mortality between Black and White adults. Identifying factors associated with these widened disparities, implementing prevention efforts, including the management and control of stroke risk factors, preventing disparities in treatment and services for long term sequelae of stroke, and tailoring interventions to advance health equity are needed to reduce disparities in stroke mortality.

* Persons listed as BNH or WNH (not including those with race listed as “more than one race” or Hispanic ethnicity listed as “not stated”) were included in this study.
† Per 100,000 persons, standardized to the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau population by age group (35–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years).
§ For AASDRs, 95% CIs are calculated using Anderson-Rosenberg methods with the normal approximations of the 95% CIs (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr47/nvs47_03.pdf). For absolute and relative differences in rates, and percent change of absolute difference in rates between BNH and WNH adults (2020–2021 versus 2015–2019), 95% CIs are estimated by the Monte Carlo simulation–based approach by sampling 5,000 normal distributions based on the AASDRs and SEs and defining the CIs as the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the simulation results using @Risk software (version 8.3.2; Palisade). https://help.palisade.com/v8/en/Guides/@RISK-Getting-Started-Guide.pdf
¶ Percent change of absolute difference in rates in 2015–2019 versus 2020–2021 between BNH and WNH adults is calculated by 1) calculating the difference of the average absolute difference in rates between BNH and WNH adults in 2020–2021 and the average absolute difference in rates between BNH and WNH adults in 2015–2019, and 2) dividing the above difference by the average absolute difference in rates between BNH and WNH adults in 2015–2019 and multiplying by 100.
** Relative difference in rates are AASDRs among BNH divided by AASDRs among WNH adults. The percent change in absolute differences between BNH and WNH adults in 2015–2019 compared with 2020–2021 might be different based on the results presented in the table because of rounding the results to one-decimal point.

§ Excess stroke deaths were calculated based on the difference between the observed versus expected stroke deaths by sex, age, and race and ethnicity during 2020–2021.

The percentages of estimated excess stroke deaths among non-Hispanic Black or African American persons (9.4%) were lower than the changes in AASDR from prepandemic to during the pandemic periods (11.2%) because of the slight trend of increased AASDR during 2015–2019. The percentages of estimated excess stroke deaths among non-Hispanic White persons (6.9%) were slightly higher than the changes in AASDR from prepandemic to during the pandemic periods (6.6%) because of the slight trend of decreased AASDR during 2015–2019.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
There is a growing awareness of racism as a cause of health inequities, health disparities, and disease.
What is added by this report?
Adults reporting experiences of racial and ethnic discrimination in health care had a significantly higher prevalence of being unvaccinated against COVID-19 overall and among most racial and ethnic groups.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Strategies to address inequitable experiences (discrimination) include increasing awareness by health care providers of patients’ potential negative health care experiences and known historical mistreatment and incorporating this sensitivity into their patient interactions. This action might foster patient trust, improve adherence to recommended health interventions, and reduce some COVID-19–related health disparities.

In 2021, the CDC Director declared that racism is a serious threat to public health,* reflecting a growing awareness of racism as a cause of health inequities, health disparities, and disease. Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19–related hospitalization and death (1,2) illustrate the need to examine root causes, including experiences of discrimination. This report describes the association between reported experiences of discrimination in U.S. health care settings and COVID-19 vaccination status and intent to be vaccinated by race and ethnicity during April 22, 2021–November 26, 2022, based on the analysis of interview data collected from 1,154,347 respondents to the National Immunization Survey–Adult COVID Module (NIS–ACM). Overall, 3.5% of adults aged ≥18 years reported having worse health care experiences compared with persons of other races and ethnicities (i.e., they experienced discrimination), with significantly higher percentages reported by persons who identified as non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (10.7%), non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (7.2%), non-Hispanic multiple or other race (multiple or other race) (6.7%), Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (4.5%), non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) (3.9%), and non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) (2.8%) than by non-Hispanic White (White) persons (1.6%). Unadjusted differences in prevalence of being unvaccinated against COVID-19 among respondents reporting worse health care experiences than persons of other races and ethnicities compared with those who reported that their health care experiences were the same as those of persons of other races and ethnicities were statistically significant overall (5.3) and for NHOPI (19.2), White (10.5), multiple or other race (5.7), Black (4.6), Asian (4.3), and Hispanic (2.6) adults. Findings were similar for vaccination intent. Eliminating inequitable experiences in health care settings might help reduce some disparities in receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine.
NIS–ACM is a random-digit–dialed mobile telephone survey of adults aged ≥18 years in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected local areas, and selected U.S. territories.† During the data collection period for this report, monthly survey response rates ranged from 17% to 23%. Reported experiences of racial and ethnic discrimination were assessed by the question, “When seeking health care in the last 2 years, do you feel your experiences were worse than, the same as, or better than (those of) persons of other races or ethnicities?” (hereafter worse, same, and better). “Don’t know” was also a valid response option. This question was adapted from CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Reactions to Race module.§ The question was field tested, cognitively tested, and approved by the Office of Management and Budget, then slightly modified for NIS-ACM by adding ethnicities and expanding the time frame to 2 years because of COVID-19. Because of the interest in examining reported inequitable experiences in health care and the association of these experiences with COVID-19 vaccination behaviors, the focus for the analysis of discrimination was a comparison of worse experiences with same experiences. COVID-19 vaccination status¶ was assessed by three questions: “Have you received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine?,” “Which brand of COVID-19 vaccine did you receive for your first dose?,” and “How many doses of a COVID-19 vaccine have you received?” The last two questions assessed completion of the primary series or partial vaccination. Among persons who had not received any COVID-19 vaccine doses, vaccination intent** was assessed by the question, “How likely are you to get a COVID-19 vaccine?” The outcomes of interest in this study were 1) being unvaccinated against COVID-19 and 2) among unvaccinated persons, definitely not intending to get vaccinated. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence differences compared those reporting experiences that were worse than and the same as those of persons of other races and ethnicities. T-tests were used to assess statistical significance of unadjusted prevalence differences. Adjusted prevalence differences were based on multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginals assessing the association of reported discrimination with vaccination status and vaccination intent, overall and by race and ethnicity, controlling for age, sex, education, poverty status, metropolitan statistical area (urban, suburban, or rural residence), U.S. Census Bureau region, and health insurance status. Adjusted and unadjusted prevalence differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. Analyses were conducted for respondents overall and separately for AI/AN, Asian, Black, Hispanic, NHOPI, White, and multiple or other race respondents. Data were weighted to represent the noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population and to adjust for nonresponse and households without a telephone. Data were calibrated to state vaccine administration data reported to CDC.†† SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SUDAAN (version 11; RTI International) were used for statistical analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§
Overall, 3.5% of respondents reported that their experiences in health care were worse than those of persons of other races and ethnicities (Supplementary Table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127243) (Supplementary Figure 1; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127237). Significantly higher percentages of having worse experiences were reported by Black (10.7%), AI/AN (7.2%), multiple or other race (6.7%), Hispanic (4.5%), NHOPI (3.9%) and Asian (2.8%) adults than by White (1.6%) adults. The prevalence of being unvaccinated against COVID-19 was significantly higher among respondents reporting worse experiences in health care than among those reporting the same experiences, with unadjusted prevalence differences of 5.3 overall, and 19.2 among NHOPI, 10.5 among White, 5.7 among multiple and other race, 4.6 among Black, 4.3 among Asian, and 2.6 among Hispanic adults (Table 1) (Figure). After adjustment, the prevalence differences associated with being unvaccinated were attenuated but remained statistically significant overall (3.2) as well as for NHOPI (14.6), White (6.1), Black (2.7), Asian, (3.8), and Hispanic (3.0) adults (Table 1) (Supplementary Figure 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127242).
Among unvaccinated respondents, the prevalence of those who stated that they were definitely not intending to get vaccinated was significantly higher among those who reported worse experiences in health care than among those who reported that their experiences were the same as those of persons of other races and ethnicities, with unadjusted prevalence differences of 3.7 overall, and 10.6 among NHOPI, 9.8 among White persons, 6.3 among multiple and other race, 3.5 among Black, and 3.0 among Hispanic (Table 2) (Figure). After adjustment, the prevalence differences were attenuated but remained statistically significant overall (2.9) and for White (6.4), multiple and other race (4.9), Black (2.6), and Hispanic (3.3) adults (Table 2) (Supplementary Figure 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127242).

Discussion
Reported experiences of racial and ethnic discrimination in health care settings were associated with a difference in prevalence of nonvaccination against COVID-19 ranging from 2.6 (Hispanic adults) to 19.2 (NHOPI adults). Among unvaccinated adults, experiencing discrimination in health care settings was associated with a prevalence difference ranging from 3.0 (Hispanic adults) to 10.6 (NHOPI adults) for respondents who were definitely not intending to get vaccinated. Other studies have attributed disparities in COVID-19 vaccination to lower confidence in vaccination and more barriers to access (3,4). Few studies, however, have examined the association between reported experiences of discrimination in health care with COVID-19 vaccination status and intent to be vaccinated. One national survey¶¶ found that U.S. adults who reported experiences of discrimination in health care had lower COVID-19 vaccination coverage. A study on influenza vaccination identified similar findings. Specifically, seasonal influenza vaccination coverage among chronically ill U.S. adults who reported experiencing discrimination in health care was one half that of those who did not report these experiences (32% versus 60%; p = 0.009) (5). Addressing experiences of discrimination in health care settings might facilitate preventive care use, including COVID-19 vaccination.
The findings in this report are subject to at least eight limitations. First, response rates for the NIS–ACM were approximately 20%; therefore, bias might occur from household nonresponse and phoneless households. Data weighting might have partially mitigated this bias. Second, COVID-19 vaccination status was self-reported and subject to misclassification because of errors in recall or social desirability; however, given the recency of COVID-19 vaccine authorization and high awareness of the pandemic, errors in vaccination recall were likely minimal. Third, this report focuses on reported discrimination in health care settings during the previous 2 years. If respondents refrained from seeking health care because of the pandemic, true rates of discrimination could be higher or lower; CDC was unaware of any data to evaluate this potential limitation. Fourth, this survey did not sample institutionalized adults, including those experiencing incarceration or living in nursing homes, which might underestimate the impact of discrimination. Fifth, the adjusted prevalence differences might be biased because of misspecification of the multivariable models. Specifically, some adjustment variables, such as socioeconomic status and health insurance status, might not truly be independent of discrimination, but instead be linked in complex ways with race and ethnicity in these experiences. Sixth, there might be some uncontrolled covariates contributing to the observed association between reported racial and ethnic discrimination and COVID-19 vaccination status or intent. Seventh, the sample size for NHOPI was small, which might have yielded unreliable estimates. However, including NHOPI permitted analysis of as many racial and ethnic groups as possible. Finally, this is a cross-sectional study; therefore, causal inferences about the impact of reported discrimination on COVID-19 vaccination status and intent cannot be made.
Reported racial and ethnic discrimination appears to be associated with at least some disparities in COVID-19 vaccine receipt; thus, eliminating inequities in health care experiences might reduce some of this disparity and potentially increase vaccination coverage among adults. Some progress was made to address disparities early in the pandemic (6). To advance vaccine equity, CDC has funded national, state, local, and community-level partners*** who work with their communities to increase vaccine access, confidence, demand, and equity by training trusted messengers, setting up vaccination clinics, and conducting community outreach in local languages and dialects.†††,§§§
Additional studies and action are needed to understand and eliminate discrimination. CDC supported the examination of discrimination in 27 states to administer the Reactions to Race module on the 2022 and 2023 BRFSS, and analysis of experiences with racism is a part of the current research agenda (Personal communication, Machell Town, CDC, January 6, 2023), including assessment of structural racism (7). Prevention programs and prevention partners (i.e., community health workers and trusted messengers) could plan ways to address health care discrimination as a source of vaccine hesitancy when implementing health strategies (8). Health care providers might foster patient trust and improve adherence to recommended health interventions by becoming aware of patients’ potential negative health care experiences and of known incidents of historical mistreatment, and incorporating this sensitivity into their patient interactions. Since the CDC Director’s declaration that racism is a serious public health threat, CDC’s scientific research to address health inequities rooted in racism has expanded across the agency with a renewed commitment to better understanding both the social determinants of health (including poverty) and the social determinants of equity (including racism) (9) and to addressing the racial and ethnic health inequities revealed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.¶¶¶

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
During January 2022, the White House launched COVIDTests.gov, a program through which all U.S. households could order free-to-the-user at-home test kits from the federal government, distributed by the U.S. Postal Service.
What is added by this report?
Awareness and acceptability of the COVIDTests.gov program is high. COVIDTests.gov test kits have improved access to COVID-19 testing, with more than 40 million households using at least one kit. The program helped to improve equity of COVID-19 home test use; non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and non-Hispanic White persons had similar use of COVIDTests.gov kits, and Black persons were 72% less likely to use other modalities for home-based testing.
What are the implications for public health practice?
National programs to address availability and accessibility of critical health services in a pandemic response have substantial health value.

At-home rapid antigen COVID-19 tests were first authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in late 2020 (1–3). In January 2022, the White House launched COVIDTests.gov, which made all U.S. households eligible to receive free-to-the-user at-home test kits distributed by the U.S. Postal Service (2). By May 2022, more than 70 million test kit packages had been shipped to households across the United States (2); however, how these kits were used, and which groups were using them, has not been reported. Data from a national probability survey of U.S. households (COVIDVu), collected during April–May 2022, were used to evaluate awareness about and use of these test kits (4). Most respondent households (93.8%) were aware of the program, and more than one half (59.9%) had ordered kits. Among persons who received testing for COVID-19 during the preceding 6 months, 38.3% used a COVIDTests.gov kit. Among kit users, 95.5% rated the experience as acceptable, and 23.6% reported being unlikely to have tested without the COVIDTests.gov program. Use of COVIDTests.gov kits was similar among racial and ethnic groups (42.1% non-Hispanic Black or African American [Black]; 41.5% Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic]; 34.8% non-Hispanic White [White]; and 53.7% non-Hispanic other races [other races]). Use of other home COVID-19 tests differed by race and ethnicity (11.8% Black, 44.4% Hispanic, 45.8% White, 43.8% other races). Compared with White persons, Black persons were 72% less likely to use other home test kits (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.16–0.50). Provision of tests through this well-publicized program likely improved use of COVID-19 home testing and health equity in the United States, particularly among Black persons. National programs to address availability and accessibility of critical health services in a pandemic response have substantial health value.
Methods of the national COVIDVu survey have been previously reported (4). In brief, a national address-based household sample derived from the U.S. Postal Service Computerized Delivery Sequence File, which covers nearly all residential delivery points in all 50 U.S. states, was recruited. During August–December 2020, 39,500 addresses were selected in a probability sample, and one household member aged ≥18 years from each address was randomly selected to participate (4,5). Among 5,666 (15.3%) respondents who completed a baseline survey, 4,654 (12.6% of sampled households; 82.1% of those who completed a baseline survey) were eligible to participate in follow-up survey rounds, based on completion of study procedures (5). Weights were derived using raking* and trimming† procedures. Demographic and geographic data were used to develop person- and household-level weights, with additional adjustments for kit ordering using the publicly available figure of 70 million COVIDTests.gov orders shipped to households (2). Extreme weights were trimmed and readjusted to reach the total sum of households and noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥18 years in the United States. Among 4,654 participants enrolled at baseline (5), 3,400 (73%) completed an online follow-up survey during April 14–May 13, 2022. Data from the 3,400 responses were weighted to allow for national estimates of COVIDTests.gov use among U.S. households (128,674,487) and adults aged ≥18 years (252,117,111). Participants were asked to specify any COVID-19 tests they had received during the previous 6 months (e.g., laboratory, pharmacy, doctor’s office, drive through site, government home test kit, or other home test kit). Awareness of the COVIDTests.gov program was assessed based on response to the question “Did you know that the government is offering free COVID-19 home test kits that can be ordered and mailed to your home?” Participants who answered “Yes” were asked if their household had ordered any of these government test kits, and whether these kits had been used by them or someone else. Those who used a government kit to self-administer a test during the previous 6 months were asked questions about the acceptability and use of the test kit. Sociodemographic variables were self-reported at baseline; weighted estimates and two-sided 95% CIs were prepared for the full sample and for the subset of respondents reporting use of a COVIDTests.gov kit. To evaluate the association between race and ethnicity and different testing modalities, aRRs and 95% CIs were estimated using weighted multivariable negative binomial regression; models were adjusted for age, sex, region, education, income, household size, and vaccination status.
All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). The COVIDVu study was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board.
In May 2022, an estimated 93.8% (120,730,524) of U.S. households were aware of the COVIDTests.gov program, and 59.9% (77,089,010) of households had ordered government kits (Figure 1). In nearly one third (32.1%; 41,325,184) of households, at least one government test kit had been used by someone within or outside the home. An estimated 27.8% (35,763,825) of households had ordered COVIDTests.gov kits but had not yet used them.
Among an estimated 252,117,111 adults, 154,160,315 (61.1%) lived in a household that had ordered kits (Table), 41.3% (63,663,434) of whom had self-administered a test kit during the preceding 6 months. Approximately one half of persons aged 18–44 years had used kits (54.6% of those aged 18–34 and 50.9% of those aged 35–44 years), compared with 35.2%, 42.1%, and 26.8% of persons aged 45–54, 55–64, and ≥65 years, respectively. The lowest kit use prevalence was in the South U.S. Census Bureau Region (35.2%), and the highest was in the West U.S. Census Bureau Region (47.4%). Among households including three or more persons, approximately one half (46.0%) used kits, compared with 38.2% of households of fewer than three persons.
Nearly one quarter (23.6%) of persons using the government kits (more than 13 million persons) indicated that they would have been unlikely to test for COVID-19 if COVIDTests.gov kits were not available; 29.7% of kit users had not used any other type of test during the preceding 6 months. The survey did not collect information about test results from each test used, but 22.2% of COVIDTests.gov kit users reported at least one positive test result within this period. Among those who used a COVIDTests.gov kit, more than 95% rated the experience as very acceptable (64.1%) or acceptable (31.4%).
Among 166,128,467 (65.9%) adults who received testing for COVID-19 during the previous 6 months, 44.2% received a laboratory or clinic test, 25.7% received a drive-through test, 38.3% used a COVIDTests.gov kit, and 42.1% used another type of at-home self-test kit (e.g., pharmacy) (Figure 2). Prevalences of COVIDTests.gov kit use differed slightly among Black (42.1%), Hispanic (41.5%), White (34.8%), and other race persons (53.7%) (p = 0.03); compared with White persons, persons of other races were more likely to use government kits (aRR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.12–1.80; p = 0.004), but Black and Hispanic persons were not. This differed from the use of other at-home self-test kits, with considerably lower use among Black (11.8%) than among Hispanic (44.4%), White (45.8%), and persons of other races (43.8%). Black persons were 72% less likely to use other home test kits compared with White persons (aRR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.16–0.50; p<0.001), despite similar use of COVIDTests.gov kits.

Discussion
In a probability sample of U.S. households, both awareness of the COVIDTests.gov program and use of kits were high, with more than 41 million households estimated to have used kits during January–May 2022. This number is likely a lower bound estimate because households might not have had sufficient time to use their ordered test kits at the time of the survey.
Prevalences of COVID-19 testing using the COVIDTests.gov kits were similar among racial and ethnic groups, a considerable difference from the highly inequitable use of other home self-tests for Black respondents observed both in this survey and in previous estimates (3). Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 illness have been widely reported (6), as have concerns about the cost and accessibility of at-home tests (7). Long-term availability of government test kits appears to have significantly improved access to COVID-19 testing for racial and ethnic minorities, underscoring a critically important and successful element of the national COVID-19 response.
The findings in this report are subject to at least one limitation. Survey weights were used to establish estimates that represent the U.S. population; however, COVIDVu respondents might have been more likely to practice preventive measures such as vaccination and testing. To adjust for this potential bias, publicly available data on COVIDTests.gov kit orders were used as part of the weighting process, ensuring that the overall estimate of kit ordering is realistic; however, other sources of bias not addressed by weighting procedures might remain.
These data indicate that provision of free COVID-19 tests through the COVIDTests.gov program was not only widely used, but also provided a mechanism for millions of persons to receive COVID-19 testing who otherwise might not have. Moreover, this program likely led to improvement in equity of COVID-19 testing. The COVIDTests.gov program was provided continuously until September 2, 2022, when it was paused; the site was reactivated on December 19, 2022 (8). These findings support the substantial health value of national programs that address critical health needs during a pandemic response.

* Raking is an iterative process that assigns a weight value to each survey respondent to ensure that the weighted distribution of the sample more closely approximates that of the sampled population. This procedure was used to align distributions with respect to gender, age, race, ethnicity, education, income, marital status, and U.S. Census Bureau region.
† Trimming is a process applied during raking to control the highest and lowest weight values. At both ends of the distribution, weights were trimmed at the 99th percentile.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
An estimated 50 million adults in the United States experienced chronic pain (i.e., pain lasting ≥3 months) in 2016, resulting in substantial health care costs and lost productivity.
What is added by this report?
During 2021, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults (51.6 million persons) experienced chronic pain, and 6.9% (17.1 million persons) experienced high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that results in substantial restriction to daily activities) with a higher prevalence among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native adults, adults identifying as bisexual, and adults who were divorced or separated.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities and ensure access to appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective pain management care for all persons.

Chronic pain (i.e., pain lasting ≥3 months) is a debilitating condition that affects daily work and life activities for many adults in the United States and has been linked with depression (1), Alzheimer disease and related dementias (2), higher suicide risk (3), and substance use and misuse (4). During 2016, an estimated 50 million adults in the United States experienced chronic pain, resulting in substantial health care costs and lost productivity (5,6). Addressing chronic pain and improving the lives of persons living with pain is a public health imperative. Population research objectives in the National Pain Strategy, which was released in 2016 by the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee, call for more precise estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that results in substantial restriction to daily activities) in the general population and within various population groups to guide efforts to reduce the impact of chronic pain (3). Further, a 2022 review of U.S. chronic pain surveillance systems identified the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) as the best source for pain surveillance data (7). CDC analyzed data from the 2019–2021 NHIS to provide updated estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain among adults in the United States and within population groups defined by demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, and health status characteristics. During 2021, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults (51.6 million persons) experienced chronic pain, and 6.9% (17.1 million persons) experienced high-impact chronic pain. New findings from this analysis include that non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults, adults identifying as bisexual, and adults who are divorced or separated are among the populations experiencing a higher prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain. Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities and ensure access to appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective pain management care for all persons (8).
NHIS is a cross-sectional, household survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).* Data were analyzed using the 2019–2021 Sample Adult Interviews.† Survey questions used to estimate the prevalence of pain included, “In the past three months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?” and “Over the past three months, how often did your pain limit your life or work activities? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?” If the participant was physically or mentally unable to respond to survey questions, then a knowledgeable proxy was permitted to answer on their behalf. Consistent with previous work, chronic pain was defined as pain on most days or every day during the previous 3 months, and high-impact chronic pain was defined as chronic pain that also limited daily life or work activities on most days or every day during the previous 3 months (5).
Using data from the 2019–2021 NHIS, the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain (including estimated number, crude rates, and age-adjusted rates with Korn-Graubard 95% CIs) were estimated for the adult U.S. population overall and within population groups defined by demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, and health status characteristics. Age-adjusted rates were calculated because the prevalence of pain is reported to vary by age (5). Estimates not meeting the NCHS reliability standards§ were not reported. Demographic characteristics included sex, age, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status, veteran status, and nativity (U.S.-born or non–U.S.-born). Geographic characteristics included region¶ and urban-rural classification. Socioeconomic characteristics included family income relative to the federal poverty level, education level, employment status, and health insurance coverage (reported separately by NHIS for adults aged <65 years and ≥65 years). Health status characteristics included general health status, disability status, and history of chronic medical conditions. Analysis was conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and used weight and variance estimation variables** that account for the complex survey design of NHIS. All reported differences between subgroups in crude rates and in age-adjusted rates were significantly different on the basis of two-tailed Z-tests (p<0.05). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††
Between 2019 and 2021, the prevalence of chronic pain among U.S. adults ranged from 20.5% to 21.8%, and the prevalence of high-impact chronic pain ranged from 6.9% to 7.8% (Figure). During 2021, an estimated 51.6 million U.S. adults (20.9%) experienced chronic pain, and 17.1 million (6.9%) experienced high-impact chronic pain (Table). The age-adjusted prevalence of both chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain was notably higher among certain demographic population groups including AI/AN adults, adults identifying as bisexual, and adults who were divorced or separated. The age-adjusted prevalence of high-impact chronic pain among AI/AN adults (12.8%) was six times as high as among non-Hispanic Asian adults (2.1%) and nearly twice as high as among non-Hispanic White adults (6.5%). The age-adjusted prevalence of chronic pain among adults identifying as bisexual was 32.9%, compared with 19.3% among adults identifying as straight and 20.7% among those identifying as gay or lesbian. The age-adjusted prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain among adults who were divorced or separated (29.6% and 10.1%, respectively) was nearly twice as high as among those who were married (18.2% and 5.2%, respectively). The age-adjusted prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain among those born in the United States (21.6% and 7.0%, respectively) was nearly twice as high as among those born outside the United States (11.9% and 4.1%, respectively).
Within population groups defined by geographic and socioeconomic characteristics, the age-adjusted prevalence of high-impact chronic pain among adults residing in nonmetropolitan areas (9.2%) and adults with a family income <100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) (14.4%) was approximately two and four times as high, respectively, as among those residing in large central metro areas (5.5%) and those with family income ≥400% FPL (3.5%). Adults reporting poor general health and adults with a disability experienced an exceptionally high prevalence of chronic pain (67.6% and 52.4%, respectively) and high-impact chronic pain (48.7% and 32.0%, respectively). Among all chronic medical conditions reported, the age-adjusted prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain was highest among adults with a history of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (70.0% and 43.8%, respectively) and dementia (54.9% and 34.2%, respectively).

Discussion
Chronic pain is a debilitating condition that affects the lives of millions of adults in the United States. During 2021, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults experienced chronic pain, similar to the reported estimate of 20.4% in 2016 (5). The estimated prevalence of high-impact chronic pain in 2021 (6.9%) was, however, lower than in 2016 (8.0%) (5). Further, the age-adjusted prevalence of high-impact chronic pain in 2021 was 6.4%, which is the goal set by the Healthy People 2030 objective to reduce the prevalence of high-impact chronic pain (9).
Findings in this report highlight important disparities in the prevalence of chronic pain among certain population groups. Consistent with previous studies, the prevalences of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain were higher among older adults, females, adults currently unemployed but who worked previously, veterans, adults living in poverty, those residing in nonmetropolitan areas, and those with public health insurance (5). This report contributes additional findings that the prevalences of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain were also higher among AI/AN adults, adults identifying as bisexual, those who are divorced or separated, U.S.-born adults compared with non–U.S.-born adults, adults with a disability, adults in poor health, and adults with a history of certain chronic medical conditions.
Previous studies have identified disparities in the treatment of chronic pain and access to affordable and effective pain management care, yet further work is needed to understand why these disparities exist and to identify opportunities for appropriate and effective interventions (10). CDC’s 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain provides recommendations to promote a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management and implementation strategies to reduce disparities in pain management care (8). In addition, policies and programs that address primary injury prevention, improved access to affordable, culturally responsive health care, and more effective pain management therapies can mitigate the burden of chronic pain (3).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the results are generalizable only to the noninstitutionalized, civilian adult population; military personnel and persons in nursing homes and other institutions were excluded. Second, survey responses are self-reported and subject to recall bias. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the collection of survey responses§§ and had impacts on health care access and utilization that might affect these results in unknown ways.
Consistent with the population research objectives of the National Pain Strategy to provide more precise estimates of pain among various population groups, this study provides updated estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain and highlights disparities in the prevalence of pain among certain populations. These findings can guide policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in future research examining the underlying reasons for disparities and in the development of tailored interventions and strategies addressing chronic pain in the United States.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Widespread vaccination has reduced invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) type b in the United States by approximately 99%, but incidence of disease caused by non-type b Hi has been increasing. CDC does not currently recommend chemoprophylaxis for contacts of persons with invasive disease caused by non-type b Hi.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of Active Bacterial Core surveillance from 10 U.S. jurisdictions identified eight instances of likely secondary transmission of non-type b Hi, all among patients with underlying medical conditions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
These results strongly suggest that secondary transmission of non-type b Hi occurs. Expansion of Hi chemoprophylaxis recommendations might be warranted to control invasive Hi disease in certain populations in the United States, but further analysis is needed to evaluate the potential benefits against the risks, such as increased antibiotic use.

Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) can cause meningitis and other serious invasive disease. Encapsulated Hi is classified into six serotypes (a–f) based on chemical composition of the polysaccharide capsule; unencapsulated strains are termed nontypeable Hi (NTHi). Hi serotype b (Hib) was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children in the pre-Hib vaccine era, and secondary transmission of Hi among children (e.g., to household contacts and in child care facilities) (1,2) led to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation for antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to prevent Hib disease in certain circumstances.* High Hib vaccination coverage since the 1990s has substantially reduced Hib disease, and other serotypes now account for most Hi-associated invasive disease in the United States (3). Nevertheless, CDC does not currently recommend chemoprophylaxis for contacts of persons with invasive disease caused by serotypes other than Hib and by NTHi (non-b Hi). Given this changing epidemiology, U.S. surveillance data were reviewed to investigate secondary cases of invasive disease caused by Hi. The estimated prevalence of secondary transmission was 0.32% among persons with encapsulated Hi disease (≤60 days of one another) and 0.12% among persons with NTHi disease (≤14 days of one another). Isolates from all Hi case pairs were genetically closely related, and all patients with potential secondary infection had underlying medical conditions. These results strongly suggest that secondary transmission of non-b Hi occurs. Expansion of Hi chemoprophylaxis recommendations might be warranted to control invasive Hi disease in certain populations in the United States, but further analysis is needed to evaluate the potential benefits against the risks, such as increased antibiotic use.
Before the introduction of Hib vaccines in the 1980s, Hib was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States, accounting for 95%–98% of all cases of invasive Hi disease (4). Studies during the pre-Hib vaccine era documented high prevalence of Hib colonization as well as secondary transmission among children exposed to Hib in a household or child care facility setting (1,2). Reported risk for secondary disease ranged from 1.2% in children aged 12–23 months (2) to 6% in infants aged <12 months (1). ACIP recommended antibiotic chemoprophylaxis in selected circumstances to prevent secondary Hib transmission. Since licensure and recommendation for Hib vaccines were implemented, the incidence of invasive Hib disease in the United States has declined by approximately 99%, accounting for only 1.3% of invasive Hi disease in 2018. However, invasive disease caused by non-b Hi, particularly serotype a (Hia) and NTHi, has been increasing. During 2008–2017, the overall incidence of Hia increased by 11.1% annually in the United States (5). Despite the changing epidemiology of Hi disease, ACIP recommendations for prevention and control of Hib disease in the United States published in 2014 stated that chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for prophylaxis against cases of invasive disease caused by non-b Hi, because secondary transmission has not been documented. Data collected as part of an active, population-based surveillance network were analyzed to investigate possible instances of secondary transmission of Hi.
Cases of invasive Hi disease were identified through Active Bacterial Core surveillance in 10 U.S. jurisdictions.† Clusters of encapsulated Hi disease were defined as cases of invasive disease caused by the same serotype diagnosed in the same county that occurred ≤60 days of one another during 2011–2018. Clusters of unencapsulated Hi disease were defined as cases of invasive NTHi disease in the same county that occurred ≤14 days of one another during 2015–2018; the restricted periods were selected because of the high incidence of NTHi and limited resources. To identify potential secondary transmission among clusters, site personnel reviewed information collected as part of the public health case investigations; patients were not recontacted for this study. Cases were only reviewed through 2018, and the data presented in this analysis is the only available data. Within each cluster, potential secondary transmission was defined as the occurrence of two or more confirmed or suspected epidemiologically linked cases. Pairs of NTHi cases occurring in a mother and infant aged <30 days were excluded from this analysis; the infant cases in these pairs occurred in the first day of life and might have resulted from intrauterine perinatal transmission. If secondary transmission was suspected, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of patient isolates was conducted to evaluate sequence relatedness through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences. Although no formal threshold for identification of related isolates exists, for this analysis, isolate pairs with fewer than 10 SNP differences were considered closely related, based on a previous analysis of Hi genetic diversity (6). Secondary transmission prevalence was calculated as the number of likely secondary cases divided by the total number of reported cases, expressed as a percentage. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§
Among 1,584 cases of encapsulated invasive Hi disease reported during 2011–2018, a total of 157 clusters with five instances of likely secondary transmission were identified, for an estimated secondary transmission prevalence among encapsulated Hi cases of 0.32% within 60 days of one another (Table 1). Three case pairs were Hi serotype f, one pair was Hia, and one pair was Hi serotype e; no secondary Hib case pairs occurred. Among 2,426 cases of NTHi disease reported during 2015–2018, a total of 373 clusters with three instances of likely secondary transmission were identified, for an estimated prevalence of secondary transmission among NTHi cases of 0.12% within 14 days of one another. All isolates from possible secondary cases had 0–1 SNP differences from the primary case isolates, indicating the isolates were genetically highly related.
Among five instances of secondary transmission of encapsulated Hi, epidemiologic links identified were in 1) household family contacts (three pairs), 2) residents in the same long-term care facility (one pair), and 3) persons experiencing homelessness (one pair, admitted to the same hospital 11 days apart) (Table 2). Among three instances of likely secondary transmission of NTHi, two pairs occurred among residents of the same long-term care facility and one occurred in residents of the same household (Table 3). All eight likely secondary cases (encapsulated and nontypeable) were diagnosed ≤2 weeks after the primary case, with six occurring ≤7 days after the primary case. All likely secondary cases occurred in patients reported to have an underlying medical condition, and all but one occurred in adults.

Discussion
Since Hib vaccine became available in the 1980s, most invasive Hi disease in the United States has been caused by non-b serotypes or nontypeable strains. Although this study found no evidence of secondary transmission among Hib clusters, possibly reflecting the effectiveness of vaccination and existing chemoprophylaxis recommendations to prevent secondary Hib infection, the findings do suggest that secondary transmission of non-b Hi likely occurs in the United States in a small percentage of cases. In all instances of likely secondary transmission of non-b Hi, the second patient had one or more underlying medical conditions that might have predisposed them to invasive infections.
Secondary transmission is not routinely assessed as part of national Hi surveillance. Other than the present analysis, the only data on possible secondary transmission of non-b Hi in the United States are from a 2019 report of two infants with Hia meningitis who attended the same child care facility in Texas and were admitted to the hospital ≤17 days of one another (7). WGS conducted at CDC revealed that both isolates were sequence type 576 with no SNP differences. Although no secondary cases were identified during a 2018 Hia outbreak in a small rural Alaskan community, an evaluation found that nasopharyngeal carriage of Hia was highest among close contacts, and no further cases occurred after administration of chemoprophylaxis (8).
Given the increasing incidence of non-b Hi disease and the occurrence of Hia outbreaks in some communities in the United States, chemoprophylaxis has been recommended for close contacts of Hia cases by jurisdictions with high Hia disease incidence. In 2018, the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services recommended that clinicians strongly consider offering chemoprophylaxis to close contacts of patients with invasive Hia, particularly when there are household contacts who are aged <4 years or who are immunocompromised.¶ This recommendation is similar to those adopted in tribal communities in the southwest United States that experience an elevated incidence of invasive disease caused by Hia and Hib (9). In addition, since 2018, the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that clinicians consider prophylaxis for cases of invasive Hia disease in households with children aged <4 years or children who are immunocompromised and recommends a similar approach to child care facility contacts in consultation with public health officials (10).
The findings in this study are subject to at least three limitations. First, prevalence of secondary transmission was likely underestimated because epidemiologic connections were established using only routinely collected data, and WGS was not performed on all isolates. Second, prevalence of secondary NTHi is likely further underestimated because the cluster definition was limited to cases that occurred within 14 days of one another, whereas 60 days is usually used for defining secondary Hi. Additional studies are needed to evaluate secondary cases of NTHi that occurred within 60 days of one another. Finally, data were only available for this analysis through 2018. Although these data might not fully reflect current Hi epidemiology, these findings strongly suggest secondary transmission of non-b Hi occurs in the United States and are relevant to guide updates to current chemoprophylaxis recommendations.
Invasive Hi disease is serious and can be life-threatening. Chemoprophylaxis taken by close contacts is effective in preventing secondary transmission of Hib and might be an important tool for preventing secondary cases of non-b Hi disease. Given the changing epidemiology of Hi in the United States and likely secondary transmission of non-b Hi documented in this report, expanding the current chemoprophylaxis recommendations might be warranted to prevent disease in certain populations and might facilitate clinical and public health decision-making, especially because chemoprophylaxis must often be offered before serotyping results are available. Further analysis is needed to evaluate the potential benefits of changing chemoprophylaxis recommendations for Hi against the risks, such as increased antibiotic use.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The World Health Organization (WHO) African Region was certified as having interrupted indigenous wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission in August 2020. In 2022, an outbreak of WPV type 1 (WPV1) was detected in southeastern Africa.
What is added by this report?
To date, one WPV1 case was detected in Malawi and eight in Mozambique. These countries and Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe implemented up to six national and subnational supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) per country and strengthened poliovirus surveillance.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Further enhancing surveillance, implementing high-quality SIAs, and strengthening routine immunization are essential to stopping WPV1 transmission within 12 months of the first case, thereby preserving the WHO African Region’s WPV-free status.

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) began in 1988, the number of wild poliovirus (WPV) cases has declined by >99.99%. Five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions have been certified free of indigenous WPV, and WPV serotypes 2 and 3 have been declared eradicated globally (1). WPV type 1 (WPV1) remains endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan (2,3). Before the outbreak described in this report, WPV1 had not been detected in southeastern Africa since the 1990s, and on August 25, 2020, the WHO African Region was certified free of indigenous WPV (4). On February 16, 2022, WPV1 infection was confirmed in one child living in Malawi, with onset of paralysis on November 19, 2021. Genomic sequence analysis of the isolated poliovirus indicated that it originated in Pakistan (5). Cases were subsequently identified in Mozambique. This report summarizes progress in the outbreak response since the initial report (5). During November 2021–December 2022, nine children and adolescents with paralytic polio caused by WPV1 were identified in southeastern Africa: one in Malawi and eight in Mozambique. Malawi, Mozambique, and three neighboring countries at high risk for WPV1 importation (Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) responded by increasing surveillance and organizing up to six rounds of national and subnational polio supplementary immunization activities (SIAs).* Although no cases of paralytic WPV1 infection have been reported in Malawi since November 2021 or in Mozambique since August 2022, undetected transmission might be ongoing because of poliovirus surveillance gaps and testing delays. Efforts to further enhance poliovirus surveillance sensitivity, improve SIA quality, and strengthen routine immunization are needed to ensure that WPV1 transmission has been interrupted within 12 months of the first case, thereby preserving the WHO African Region’s WPV-free status.

Detection of WPV1
During November 2021–December 2022, and as of April 7, 2023, nine cases of paralytic polio caused by WPV1 had been detected in southeastern Africa. One case was previously reported in Lilongwe, Malawi (5), with onset of paralysis on November 19, 2021, and eight cases were identified in Mozambique (all in Tete Province in the country’s northwestern region) (Figure 1), with the latest onset on August 10, 2022. Several of the cases in Mozambique occurred in children and adolescents living close to international borders with Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. At paralysis onset, patient age ranged from 5 months to 14 years (median = 59 months). Five of the nine cases occurred in children and adolescents aged ≥5 years. Only two of the patients had received ≥3 doses of oral polio vaccine, the minimum required for adequate protection from type 1 polioviruses. Delays were reported in confirming all nine cases: a median of 53 days (range = 36–96 days) elapsed from the onset of paralysis to reporting genomic sequencing results, primarily because of delays in international stool specimen transport but also because of delays in case detection and in testing of stool samples and isolates upon their receipt in the laboratories.
Genomic sequence analysis of all polioviruses isolated in this outbreak demonstrated that the closest relative was a WPV1 lineage detected in Sindh, Pakistan in October 2019 (5). Extensive nucleotide changes detected among outbreak isolates indicated that WPV1 had been circulating in southeastern Africa for approximately 2 years before detection of the Malawi case.
Top
Routine Immunization
Routine immunization of all children with a polio vaccine is the cornerstone to prevention of disease transmission worldwide. In 2021, all five countries involved in this response had gaps in their routine immunization coverage for bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV, containing Sabin-strain serotypes 1 and 3), with none reaching the 90% national target recommended by WHO’s Global Vaccine Action Plan.† In 2021, national coverage estimates for 3 doses of bOPV were 89% in Malawi, 67% in Mozambique, 70% in Tanzania, 87% in Zambia, and 86% in Zimbabwe. Efforts to strengthen polio routine immunization were made in all countries throughout 2022; the July 2023 release of 2022 global coverage estimates by WHO and UNICEF is anticipated to evaluate the success of these interventions.
Top
Poliovirus Surveillance
Poliovirus transmission is detected primarily through surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children and adolescents aged <15 years accompanied by testing of stool specimens at a WHO-accredited laboratory in the Global Polio Laboratory Network. Two core AFP surveillance performance indicators are the nonpolio AFP (NPAFP) rate§ and stool adequacy rate¶ (6). During 2022, GPEI supported ministries of health in the two affected and three at-risk countries by deploying staff members to high-risk districts. There they assisted with conducting active surveillance visits to health facilities, sensitizing local clinicians and public health workers regarding AFP recognition and reporting, conducting community case searches for additional children and adolescents with paralysis, performing AFP case investigations and follow-up exams, fast-tracking sample transportation from the point of collection to the laboratory, and conducting other surveillance-strengthening activities.
An NPAFP rate of two or more cases per 100,000 population aged <15 years is the global benchmark for surveillance that is sufficiently sensitive to detect a case of polio. During 2021 (before detection of the Malawi case), review of NPAFP surveillance performance in the outbreak-response countries identified many gaps at the district level (Figure 2). Among 554 districts within the five countries, 370 (67%) achieved this benchmark NPAFP rate. During 2022, subnational NPAFP rates improved markedly; 512 (92%) districts achieved the benchmark.
Among the five countries, two (Tanzania and Zimbabwe) achieved national-level stool adequacy rates of ≥80% in 2021 (98.5% and 91.5%, respectively) and 2022 (98.2% and 91.3%, respectively). However, national data can obscure considerable gaps in stool adequacy at the district level. For example, in 2022, 96% of districts in Tanzania and 87% in Zimbabwe achieved the 80% benchmark. In Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, this benchmark was achieved in only 43%, 52%, and 34% of districts, respectively. Without adequate stool specimens being delivered for laboratory analysis, additional cases of polio cannot be detected, and the full scope of the WPV1 outbreak cannot be known.
Environmental surveillance (testing of sewage for poliovirus) can supplement AFP surveillance. Environmental surveillance sites are considered reliably functioning when ≥50% of samples collected yield nonpolio enteroviruses (NPEVs). Before the outbreak, environmental sampling had been established in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia; however, only Tanzania and Zambia had reliable, functioning environmental sampling programs. With intensive efforts by ministries of health and GPEI in 2022, environmental sampling was initiated in Malawi, and the number of sites in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia was increased. The 50% NPEV detection target rate was achieved in six of 12 sites in Malawi, three of 14 in Mozambique, 10 of 11 in Tanzania, and 11 of 11 in Zambia. As of April 7, 2023, no sample collected at an environmental surveillance site during 2021–2022 in any of these countries has tested positive for WPV1.
Top
Supplementary Immunization Activities
With technical assistance from GPEI, the five outbreak response countries initiated a series of SIAs with bOPV within 33 days of the notification of WPV1 in Malawi; the SIAs targeted children aged <5 years. Four countries (Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia) synchronized their initial response SIAs conducted in March 2022. However, subsequent rounds were not synchronized because of a variety of logistical constraints. In total, during 2022, Malawi conducted four national rounds, Tanzania and Zambia each conducted three, and Mozambique and Zimbabwe each conducted two. Subnational rounds were conducted in Mozambique (four), Tanzania (one), and Zambia (one).** During the sixth SIA in Mozambique, the target age range was increased to children and adolescents aged <15 years from children aged <5 years, because five of Mozambique’s eight WPV1 cases were detected in patients aged ≥5 years.
The quality of the SIAs was assessed by lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) surveys within a week of SIA completion. In each district (lot) surveyed, six settlements were randomly selected, and 10 children from the SIA’s target age group were randomly selected within each.†† If at least 57 of the 60 selected persons had been vaccinated, the SIA was considered to be high-quality in that district (i.e., the district passed, with evidence that coverage is approaching 90%).§§ After the first SIAs in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, fewer than 35% of districts passed based on LQAS results; however, assessed quality improved substantially during subsequent rounds (Figure 3). By the third SIA round in Mozambique and Tanzania, and the fourth round in Malawi and Zambia, more than 70% of districts passed based on LQAS results. Zimbabwe’s SIA quality also improved between the country’s first and second rounds.
Importantly, three of the six districts in Malawi and Mozambique where WPV1 cases were found failed LQAS in 50% of their countries’ SIA rounds; failures occurred in both early and later rounds. In Mozambique, this included the Moatize district, where four of the nine WPV1 cases had been detected during this outbreak.

Discussion
All countries, including those that are polio-free, must be vigilant against importation of poliovirus and establishment of local transmission. The risk for importation and local transmission has been demonstrated by WPV1 detection in Malawi and transmission in Mozambique. GPEI partners and ministries of health in the five southeastern African countries have exhibited efficient collaboration in this outbreak response, extending from the international coordination level to the dedicated frontline health workers. Government engagement has been high in all five countries, despite many competing priorities. The establishment of national-level emergency operations centers for poliovirus responses has facilitated increased coordination and collaboration among GPEI partners. Surge GPEI international and national technical support has augmented existing personnel, particularly when addressing hard-to-reach areas and strengthening AFP surveillance efforts for timely detection.
Alongside these successes, the WPV1 outbreak response in southeastern Africa has faced several challenges. Although WPV1 transmission appears to have been interrupted, the identification of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) type 1 in Malawi and Mozambique during 2022 indicates ongoing local susceptibility to type 1 poliovirus (7). Global bOPV supply limitations led to delayed or smaller-scale SIAs in the outbreak response countries, which might not have been of sufficient magnitude to stop WPV1 transmission. Results of LQAS surveys in the six districts where WPV1 cases were reported indicate that SIAs might also have been of insufficiently high quality to stop transmission. In addition, cocirculation of cVDPV type 1 in Malawi and Mozambique and cVDPV type 2 in Mozambique and Zambia led to resource and logistical constraints in the response to the WPV1 outbreak (7). Prevention of further cross-border transmission could be accomplished through continued improved collaboration among bordering countries.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, gaps in poliovirus surveillance and delays in specimen testing could result in ongoing undetected transmission. Second, routine immunization coverage estimates are based on administrative data and might be inaccurate because of errors in recording doses administered or in estimating the target population; as a result, gaps in immunity might be underestimated. Finally, LQAS survey results might not be representative of the true proportion of children reached during each SIA.
The WHO Africa Regional Certification Commission has indicated that this outbreak does not currently affect Africa’s WPV-free certification, because it occurred after virus importation from Pakistan. However, if transmission continues ≥12 months after outbreak confirmation, this certification is at risk. For the WHO African Region to remain WPV-free, intensified efforts should focus on enhancing surveillance sensitivity and timeliness, improving SIA quality, and strengthening routine immunization efforts.

§ The NPAFP rate is an indicator of surveillance sensitivity; the global benchmark is detection of two or more NPAFP cases per 100,000 children and adolescents aged <15 years per year in nonoutbreak conditions, and three or more NPAFP cases per 100,000 children and adolescents aged <15 years per year during outbreaks.
¶ Stool adequacy refers to the percentage of AFP patient stool specimens that are collected within 14 days of paralysis onset and arrive at the laboratory in good condition. Stool adequacy rates ≥80%, the global benchmark, demonstrate that poliovirus can be effectively isolated from AFP stool samples if present.
** By country, national and subnational rounds occurred during the following approximate date ranges: Malawi (March 21–October 16); Mozambique (March 21–December 11); Tanzania (March 24–December 4); Zambia (March 21–October 30); and Zimbabwe (October 27–December 4).
†† Because the sixth SIA round in Mozambique targeted children and adolescents aged <15 years, the LQAS surveys for this round targeted children and adolescents in this age group.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Racial and ethnic disparities in monkeypox (mpox) incidence and vaccination have been described.
What is added by this report?
During May 10–December 31, 2022, mpox incidence among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) males was higher than that among non-Hispanic White (White) males. Although overall ≥1-dose JYNNEOS vaccination rates were higher among Black and Hispanic males than White males, they were not high enough to fully offset the disproportionate incidence. Overall, 43 White, nine Black, and 17 Hispanic males were vaccinated for each reported mpox case within these groups.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Sustained equity-based strategies, such as tailored messaging and expanding vaccination services to reach racial and ethnic minority groups, are needed to prevent disparities in future mpox outbreaks.

Table 1
Table 2
As of December 31, 2022, a total of 29,939 monkeypox (mpox) cases* had been reported in the United States, 93.3% of which occurred in adult males. During May 10–December 31, 2022, 723,112 persons in the United States received the first dose in a 2-dose mpox (JYNNEOS)† vaccination series; 89.7% of these doses were administered to males (1). The current mpox outbreak has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and racial and ethnic minority groups (1,2). To examine racial and ethnic disparities in mpox incidence and vaccination rates, rate ratios (RRs) for incidence and vaccination rates and vaccination-to-case ratios were calculated, and trends in these measures were assessed among males aged ≥18 years (males) (3). Incidence in males in all racial and ethnic minority groups except non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) males was higher than that among non-Hispanic White (White) males. At the peak of the outbreak in August 2022, incidences among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) males were higher than incidence among White males (RR = 6.9 and 4.1, respectively). Overall, vaccination rates were higher among males in racial and ethnic minority groups than among White males. However, the vaccination-to-case ratio was lower among Black (8.8) and Hispanic (16.2) males than among White males (42.5) during the full analytic period, indicating that vaccination rates among Black and Hispanic males were not proportionate to the elevated incidence rates (i.e., these groups had a higher unmet vaccination need). Efforts to increase vaccination among Black and Hispanic males might have resulted in the observed relative increased rates of vaccination; however, these increases were only partially successful in reducing overall incidence disparities. Continued implementation of equity-based vaccination strategies is needed to further increase vaccination rates and reduce the incidence of mpox among all racial and ethnic groups. Recent modeling data (4) showing that, based on current vaccination coverage levels, many U.S. jurisdictions are vulnerable to resurgent mpox outbreaks, underscore the need for continued vaccination efforts, particularly among racial and ethnic minority groups.
Data on confirmed and probable cases of mpox were electronically sent by health departments to CDC as part of national case surveillance through a standardized case report form§ or to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.¶ Data on JYNNEOS vaccine doses administered were reported to CDC by U.S. jurisdictions (2) using a reporting system adapted from protocols originally developed for reporting data on COVID-19 vaccine administration. Case and first-dose vaccination data for males** aged ≥18 years across seven racial and ethnic groups†† were included in this analysis; analysis was limited to males because approximately 94% of cases occurred in this group, and 90% of vaccine doses were administered to males. Incidence and vaccination rates were calculated as cases and vaccinations, respectively, per 100,000 MSM because the MSM population was disproportionately affected by the current mpox outbreak. The number of MSM in each racial and ethnic group was estimated by multiplying each racial and ethnic group’s adult male population§§ by 3.9%, the estimated percentage of U.S. men who reported having sex with a man in the previous 5 years.¶¶ (5,6).
Incidence and vaccination rates were calculated by race and ethnicity (Asian, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN], Black, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic multiple races or other races). Because Black, Hispanic, and White males accounted for >88% of mpox cases in males and 83% of JYNNEOS doses administered to males, this report focuses primarily on these three groups. RRs for incidence and vaccination rates were calculated for Black and Hispanic males, with White males as the reference population. The vaccination-to-case ratio was calculated as the number of adult males within a group who received a first dose of vaccine during a given period divided by the number of mpox cases in that group during the same period (3).*** This metric was used to ascertain whether higher vaccination rates in racial and ethnic minority groups were proportional to higher mpox incidence in these groups. All disparity measures were calculated for the overall outbreak period (May–December 2022) and for subperiods during 2022: May–June, July, August, September, and October–December (May–June and October–December were combined into single periods, because case and vaccination counts were low during those months). R statistical software (version 4.2.1; R Foundation) was used to conduct all analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and policy.†††
During May 10–December 31, 2022, a total of 27,946 mpox cases were reported among males aged ≥18 years, including 30.7% in Black males, 29.5% in Hispanic males, and 27.9% in White males (Table 1). Among 648,336 first-dose vaccinations administered to adult males, 11.6%, 20.6% and 51.1% were administered to Black, Hispanic, and White males, respectively. Mpox incidence and vaccination rates were highest in August 2022 for all racial and ethnic groups, with the exception of incidence among White males, which peaked in July. Mpox incidence and vaccination rates subsequently declined through December (Table 2).
During May 10–December 31, 2022, mpox case incidences were higher among racial and ethnic minority males than those among White males, except Asian males, whose incidence was similar to that among White males. Disparities in mpox incidence peaked in August, particularly among Black (RR = 6.9) and Hispanic (RR = 4.1) males, relative to White males. After incidence peaked in August, disparities decreased slightly through December; however, substantial disparities in incidence remained during October–December.
During May 10–December 31, 2022, overall vaccination rates were typically higher among all racial and ethnic minority adult males, except AI/AN males, than rates among White males. However, early in the outbreak (during May–June), vaccination rates among Black and Hispanic males were lower than those among White males (RR = 0.4 and 0.7, respectively), and by August, rates among Black and Hispanic males exceeded those among White males (RR = 1.3 and RR = 1.4, respectively).
The vaccination-to-case ratio aggregated across all racial and ethnic groups during the full analytic period was 23.8. The highest vaccination-to-case ratios were observed among Asian (59.2) and White (42.5) males, whereas those among Hispanic and Black males were the lowest (16.2 and 8.8, respectively). From the beginning of the outbreak (May–June) to its peak (August), all groups showed increases in vaccination-to-case ratios, reflecting higher vaccination availability during this period. However, across each separate period examined, vaccination-to-case ratios were lowest among Black and Hispanic males (Figure).
Top
Discussion
Analysis of mpox case and vaccine administration data by race and ethnicity provides three important insights. First, there are notable disparities in mpox incidence, characterized by higher rates among males in most racial and ethnic minority groups compared with rates among White males. Second, males in most racial and ethnic minority groups had slightly higher vaccination rates than White males; however, these higher vaccination rates were not sufficiently high to fully offset the disproportionate mpox incidences in these groups. Finally, vaccination-to-case ratios indicated that there is a higher unmet vaccination need among racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly among Black and Hispanic males.
Concerted efforts to increase vaccination among racial and ethnic groups might have contributed to increases in vaccination rates among racial and ethnic minority males (2). For example, in September 2022, CDC implemented the mpox vaccine equity pilot program to ensure that vaccination efforts reached communities most affected by the outbreak.§§§ In addition, initiation of intradermal vaccine administration on August 9, 2022,¶¶¶ increased available doses by three to five–fold, leading to increased access to vaccination (1,7,8).
The vaccination-to-case ratio, a novel measure of vaccination relative to incidence, estimated that approximately 43 White males were vaccinated for each reported mpox case among White males, whereas only nine Black and 16 Hispanic males received mpox vaccination for each reported mpox case within these groups. These findings suggest that the higher vaccination rates among Black and Hispanic males compared with White males (RR = 1.2 and 1.4, respectively) were not commensurate with their higher mpox incidence (RRs = 5.8 and 3.6, respectively). These groups still had higher unmet vaccination needs relative to their mpox incidence. Accordingly, substantially higher vaccination rates among Black and Hispanic males are needed to address the disproportionate incidence and unmet vaccination needs in these groups.
Racial and ethnic disparities in mpox incidence are driven by several factors, including social determinants of health. Black and Hispanic males might face barriers to prevention, including access to information and to mpox vaccines resulting from gaps in dissemination of information, language barriers, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, stigma, discrimination, unemployment, and poverty (9). In addition, homophily in sexual partnership selection patterns has been associated with increased disparities in the incidence of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV (10) and might be associated with disparities in mpox incidence.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because of data availability, this analysis was limited to adult males and might not be representative of other population groups. Second, data on the race and ethnicity for 6% of patients and 3% of vaccine recipients were missing, which might limit the interpretation of some racial and ethnic disparities. Third, when calculating reported cases and vaccine recipients, it was not possible to confirm that all males included in the reported case and vaccine recipient numerators were members of the denominator (MSM). Finally, incidence and vaccination rates were calculated using MSM population estimates as the denominator; using population estimates of MSM at increased risk for mpox as the denominator might have substantially increased the estimated incidence and vaccination rates. Using population estimates of the entire adult male population as the denominator would have decreased the estimated incidence and vaccination rates; however, in both scenarios the incidence RRs, vaccination RRs, and vaccination-to-case ratios would be similar to findings in this report.
Findings from this analysis indicate that racial and ethnic disparities in mpox incidence rates peaked during August and September 2022 and decreased slightly toward the end of December 2022, potentially as a result of focused public health efforts. However, racial and ethnic disparities in incidence still exist, and eliminating these disparities remains a priority for continued mpox response efforts. Higher mpox vaccination rates among racial and ethnic minority groups are encouraging, but an unmet vaccination need relative to incidence in racial and ethnic minority groups remains. These findings illustrate the potential impact of and continued need for equity-based vaccination strategies, such as community-specific tailored messaging and expansion of vaccination services to reach racial and ethnic minority groups. Recent modeling data (4) showing that, based on current vaccination coverage levels, many U.S. jurisdictions are vulnerable to resurgent mpox outbreaks, underscore the need for continued vaccination efforts, particularly among racial and ethnic minority groups.

¶¶ The number of MSM was estimated by assuming 3.9% of adult males in all racial and ethnic groups are MSM, based on a 2012 meta-analysis of four population-based surveys. This value was applied in subsequent studies to estimate the U.S. MSM population. This analysis used the entire MSM population aged ≥18 years as the denominator for mpox case rates and mpox vaccination rates. However, if racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately represented in the subpopulation of MSM at highest risk for mpox (e.g., MSM with HIV and MSM with indications for HIV preexposure prophylaxis), the use of subpopulations of MSM with highest risk for mpox as the denominator for mpox incidence rates could mask racial and ethnic incidence disparities. For example, assuming that all MSM at high risk for mpox have the same monthly risk for acquiring mpox, but MSM in racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be at high risk for mpox than White MSM, no racial and ethnic incidence disparities would be observed when the analysis was limited to MSM at high risk. Conversely, using the entire MSM population as the denominator for mpox vaccination rates could mask racial and ethnic mpox vaccination disparities among those most in need of vaccination. However, using the same denominator (all MSM) for mpox case rates and mpox vaccination rates allowed for consistency in comparing racial and ethnic disparities in these two outcomes.
*** CIs for disparity measures in reported mpox incidence and vaccination rates were not calculated because the numerators of these rate calculations were the actual number of reported cases and vaccinations, not estimates of the number of cases and vaccinations. Although an estimate (the MSM population size) was used in the denominators of the mpox incidence and vaccination rates, use of the estimated MSM population size affected only the absolute magnitude of the rates, not the relative comparisons of rates across racial and ethnic groups. Because the MSM population was estimated assuming MSM account for 3.9% of adult males in each racial and ethnic group, using the entire adult male population as the denominator would result in incidence and vaccination rates that are approximately 3.9% as high (for all racial and ethnic groups) as the rates when estimated using the MSM population as the denominator and would have practically no effect on the rate ratios and vaccination-to-case ratios.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Severe manifestations of mpox have occurred in the United States, particularly among persons with uncontrolled viral spread resulting from moderately to severely immunocompromising conditions.
What is added by this report?
Thirty-eight mpox-associated deaths occurred in the United States during May 10, 2022–March 7, 2023 (1.3 mpox-associated deaths per 1,000 cases). Most decedents were non-Hispanic Black or African American (87%) persons and cisgender men (95%). Among 24 decedents with HIV for whom data were available, all had advanced HIV, typically with a CD4 count <50.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Equitable and early access to prevention and treatment for both mpox and HIV is critical to reducing mpox-related mortality.

As of March 7, 2023, a total of 30,235 confirmed and probable monkeypox (mpox) cases were reported in the United States,† predominantly among cisgender men§ who reported recent sexual contact with another man (1). Although most mpox cases during the current outbreak have been self-limited, cases of severe illness and death have been reported (2–4). During May 10, 2022–March 7, 2023, 38 deaths among persons with probable or confirmed mpox¶ (1.3 per 1,000 mpox cases) were reported to CDC and classified as mpox-associated (i.e., mpox was listed as a contributing or causal factor). Among the 38 mpox-associated deaths, 94.7% occurred in cisgender men (median age = 34 years); 86.8% occurred in non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons. The median interval from symptom onset to death was 68 days (IQR = 50–86 days). Among 33 decedents with available information, 93.9% were immunocompromised because of HIV. Public health actions to prevent mpox deaths include integrated testing, diagnosis, and early treatment for mpox and HIV, and ensuring equitable access to both mpox and HIV prevention and treatment, such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) (5).
Data included in this report were collected during May 10, 2022–March 7, 2023. Jurisdictional health departments electronically reported confirmed and probable mpox cases and associated deaths as part of national case surveillance. Case data were shared with CDC through a standardized case report form or through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.** Additional data (e.g., clinical course, co-occurring health conditions, and treatments received) about some decedents were collected during consultations between treating clinicians and CDC clinical officers.†† Cause of death was most commonly determined by the treating health care provider and reported on the death certificate. Jurisdictional health departments shared cause-of-death data as reported on the death certificate to support classification of deaths. Deaths were classified as mpox-associated if mpox was listed on Part I or Part II of the death certificate (chain of events that directly caused the death or significant conditions contributing to death, respectively). Deaths were classified as non–mpox-associated if mpox was not listed on the death certificate, or if mpox appeared to be incidental to death. Deaths were classified as being under investigation§§ if jurisdictions were reviewing the cause-of-death with health care providers at the time of this analysis.
Descriptive statistics on demographics (e.g., age, gender identity, race and ethnicity, and state of residence) and clinical characteristics (i.e., treatments received and timing of treatments) were calculated for all patients with an mpox-associated death and were compared between decedents and patients who are presumed to have survived after confirmed or probable mpox (survivors). SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for all analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶
CDC received reports of 52 deaths among persons with confirmed or probable mpox. Thirty-eight deaths (73.1%) were classified as mpox-associated, three (5.8%) were non–mpox-associated,*** and 11 (21.2%) deaths remain under investigation. Among the 38 mpox-associated deaths, 25 (65.8%) occurred during October–November 2022 (Figure).
The median age of decedents was 34 years (range = 22–58 years), and 36 (94.7%) were cisgender men (Table 1). A higher proportion of decedents than survivors were Black (86.8% versus 32.9%). Nearly one half of decedents (47.4%) resided in the U.S. Census Bureau South Region††† compared with 39.4% of survivors who lived in this region. Nine of the 10 decedents with recent sexual or intimate contact information had sexual or intimate contact with cisgender men in the 3 weeks preceding symptom onset. Two decedents reported nonsexual close contact exposures (e.g., co-sleeping and caring for a household member) to persons with mpox. Five of 11 decedents with available data were experiencing homelessness. Among 87% of decedents and 45% of survivors with available information, HIV infection was more prevalent among decedents than survivors (93.9% versus 38.3%).
Among 27 (71.0%) decedents with available clinical data, the median interval from symptom onset to death was 68 days (range = 1–146 days; IQR = 50–86 days), and 87.0% (20 of 23) were admitted to an intensive care unit during hospitalization (Table 2). Overall, 25 (92.6%) of 27 decedents with available treatment information received mpox-directed medical therapeutics§§§ at some point during their clinical care, including 25 who received tecovirimat, 18 of 24 who received vaccinia immunoglobulin intravenous (VIGIV), nine of 22 who received cidofovir, and six of 15 who received brincidofovir. Among the 25 decedents who received tecovirimat, 15 (60.0%) received it within 3 days of mpox diagnosis; however, for six (24.0%) decedents, tecovirimat was not administered until ≥3 weeks after diagnosis (median overall interval = 2 days; IQR = 0–20 days). Among 24 decedents with available data, all had lesions described as necrotic, diffuse, or worsened after a 14-day course of tecovirimat.
Two decedents did not receive any mpox therapeutics based on clinician discretion; in one case because of concerns regarding contraindication associated with other comorbidities. The other decedent was on ART for HIV with an undetectable viral load at the time of initial assessment for mpox care. Approximately 1 month later, at a wellness check, the patient was found deceased with diffuse lesions characteristic of mpox. Seven of 27 decedents for whom information was available refused therapeutic or intravenous medications or left the hospital against medical advice at some point during their clinical course of treatment. Among 24 decedents with information on receipt of steroids, more than one half (54.2%) received steroids for mpox complications or concerns about immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), a hyperinflammatory response that can occur in patients with HIV during the first 6 months of ART (6).
Nearly all decedents with complete data on HIV infection were HIV-positive (93.9%; 31 of 33). Among 24 decedents with HIV and available data, all (100%) had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3; 23 (95.8%) had CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3. Among the two immunocompromised decedents who did not have HIV, one was presumed to have been immunocompromised as a consequence of undiagnosed diabetes; the patient experienced diabetic ketoacidosis, a severe life-threatening complication of diabetes, at the time of mpox diagnosis. The second decedent was severely immunocompromised because of a recent renal transplant complicated by acute rejection.
Only two of the 25 persons with HIV (8.0%) reported taking ART before mpox diagnosis; in one of these decedents, HIV was poorly controlled. ART was initiated for 19 of the 20 decedents who were not receiving ART, including one decedent who received a diagnosis of HIV infection 5 days after the mpox diagnosis. One decedent refused treatment for advanced HIV. ART treatment status was not known for three of the 25 decedents with HIV. ART was either delayed or interrupted for seven decedents because of clinician concerns about IRIS.

Discussion
During the 2022 mpox outbreak, 1.3 mpox-associated deaths per 1,000 cases occurred in the United States and approximately 1.2 deaths per 1,000 mpox cases occurred worldwide.¶¶¶ Nearly all U.S. mpox decedents were immunocompromised at the time of diagnosis. Almost 90% of U.S. mpox-associated deaths occurred in Black men, whereas fewer than one in three mpox survivors were Black men. Although mpox exposure data were not available for all decedents, nearly all cisgender male decedents who reported recent sexual contact reported cisgender male partners.
Most decedents received one or more prompt mpox-directed treatments and intensive care. However, nearly one quarter of decedents experienced delays of 3–7 weeks between diagnosis and treatment, and two patients did not receive any mpox-directed treatment. Before the 2022 mpox epidemic, severe cases mainly occurred in resource-constrained settings where transmission is endemic and where treatments, such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and VIGIV, are not routinely available (6).
The lengthy course of illness experienced by most decedents is likely related to a reduced capacity to respond to infection because of co-occurring immunocompromise. When mpox is suspected, providers should consider early treatment with mpox-directed therapy, especially for patients with immunocompromising conditions who are at highest risk for severe outcomes.
The gender and racial disparities in mpox-associated deaths align with previous reports, in which most patients hospitalized for severe manifestations of mpox were Black men with uncontrolled HIV (4) and parallel racial and ethnic disparities in HIV infection and mortality. In 2020, 75% of all-cause deaths among adults with HIV occurred in males, 39% of whom were Black males.**** Disparities and barriers are apparent at all levels of HIV care including recognition of HIV risk, access to testing, and access to and receipt of preexposure prophylaxis and ART (7).
Most decedents with advanced HIV were not on ART at the time mpox was diagnosed. Boosting immune function via ART and avoidance of immunosuppressives, such as steroids, are critical to mpox recovery (6). ART was delayed or discontinued for several decedents because of concerns of IRIS, wherein a sudden improvement of immune function paradoxically worsens an infection. To date, no evidence exists indicating that IRIS contributes to poor mpox outcomes.
The Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative†††† has highlighted the need to address HIV transmission in the United States through response, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment efforts. All patients with suspected mpox should be evaluated for preexisting immunocompromising conditions such as HIV (7). Persons with diagnosed mpox who have HIV (even if newly diagnosed) who are not on ART should be started on ART as soon as possible. For persons who are HIV-negative, indications for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis should be assessed.
Previous studies of mpox patients, in Nigeria, have documented anxiety, depression (8), and suicide (9). It has been suggested (9) that these outcomes resulted from stigma and the implications of acquiring a sexually associated infection, such as mpox, as well as the isolation experienced during prolonged treatment. Black and Hispanic or Latino males in the United States might face additional psychosocial pressures related to language barriers, homophobia, and discrimination (10). One suicide was noted among the decedents of non–mpox-associated deaths, and one decedent persistently declined treatment for HIV. These data highlight the need to strengthen psychosocial support services as part of the mpox epidemic response.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, deaths might be undercounted. Delays in reporting laboratory results, cases, and deaths are expected because reporting guidance was developed concurrently with the outbreak. Because reports from clinical consults were passively obtained, some deaths related to patients with mpox might not have been recorded. Second, some data (e.g., housing status, treatment, HIV status, and CD4 count) were more frequently available for decedents than for survivors because of additional reporting requirements for those who received intensive mpox treatments, thus limiting the comparisons between these two groups.
These findings highlight the importance of integrating prevention, testing, and treatment for multiple sexually associated infections (e.g., mpox and HIV, among others). Equitable access to prevention, treatment, and engagement and retention in care for both mpox and HIV should be prioritized, particularly among Black men and other persons at risk for sexually associated infections. These results underscore previous recommendations that providers offer HIV testing to all patients with probable or confirmed mpox and consider early mpox-directed treatment in highly immunocompromised patients (4,5,7). Further, combining therapies for mpox and boosting immune function might also reduce mortality from severe mpox (5).

","Notes From the Field: Campylobacteriosis Outbreak Associated with Consumption of Raw Water â Montana, 2022

Consumption of raw water (water that has not been disinfected or filtered) has become an emerging trend in the United States and could pose serious health consequences (1). Drinking water collected directly from outdoor freshwater sources such as lakes, rivers, and streams that has not been adequately treated (i.e., to remove pathogens) can cause disease and outbreaks (2). This report describes how a community in Western Montana responded to an outbreak of 19 cases of diarrheal illness associated with consuming untreated surface water.
On May 9, 2022, Sanders County, Montana, reported to the state health department six active cases of Campylobacter infection in their community; this case count represented a substantial increase above the 5-year average of six reported cases annually during 2017–2021. All infected persons reported drinking water from watering point A, an outlet of surface water from a creek near Paradise, Montana (Figure), before their onset of symptoms, which began on or after May 4. During the next 6 weeks, 13 additional cases of Campylobacter jejuni infection among persons exposed to the same water source were identified through laboratory testing (two by culture-independent confirmation and four by culture confirmation) or epidemiologic linkage (seven). One person was hospitalized, and no deaths were reported.
On May 16, Sanders County Public Health environmental health staff members collected 23 liters of water from watering point A. The Montana Laboratory Services Bureau performed membrane filtration on 15 liters of the water sample, using four separate filters (0.45 μm [44 mm] pore size). The filters were then plated on media for Campylobacter culture and isolation following standard methods (3); investigators did not culture for or find any other pathogens. On May 24, the water sample was confirmed positive for Campylobacter by culture. On June 3, staff members performed whole genome sequencing on one Campylobacter isolate from the water sample and isolates from two human outbreak specimens; sequences were compared by both core genome multilocus sequence typing and whole genome multilocus sequence typing (4). Campylobacter isolates from the human specimens and water samples were highly genetically related (0–1 allele apart). Together, whole genome sequencing analysis and epidemiologic data provided confirmatory evidence that this outbreak was the result of drinking water directly from watering point A.
Watering point A is located within the Montana Department of Transportation highway right-of-way on railroad property. The watering point was constructed, most likely during the early 1900s, to prevent the creek from eroding the track bed. Owners of adjacent land began using the water for domestic and agricultural purposes. Since then, the public has used watering point A as a drinking water source. Although watering point A contains untreated surface water, many community members believe that it is a natural spring. Users filled containers by placing them directly under water spilling out of the concrete box of the watering point, by placing containers directly into the water in the box, or by placing pumps or suction lines into the water to fill large containers. Signage posted by the Montana Department of Transportation before the outbreak warned the public that the watering point was not an approved public water source.
An unoccupied bird’s nest was found inside the box where the water sample was collected. Birds are a known source of Campylobacter, and although no birds were present at the time of sample collection, the presence of the nest indicates birds could have been the primary contamination source that led to this outbreak.
The combined strength of the epidemiologic, environmental, and laboratory evidence in this outbreak was sufficient to remove the watering source from operation. After a June 16 meeting with stakeholders, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality stated the source met the definition of a public water supply and therefore needed to meet the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act (5), or access had to be permanently removed. The Montana Department of Transportation permanently removed public access on June 28, 2022, by rerouting the creek water so that it remained underground (Figure). No additional cases have been identified since June 16, 2022. Persons drinking water from outdoor sources, including creeks, rivers, and streams, should always treat the water before drinking it. Boiling water is the most reliable way to kill germs, but treatment including filtration will also reduce the risk of illness from drinking water from outdoor sources.*

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In the United States, the timing of seasonal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemics (October–April) was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
What is added by this report?
RSV circulation was historically low during 2020–21 and began earlier and continued longer during 2021–22 than during prepandemic seasons. The 2022–23 season started later than the 2021–22 season but earlier than prepandemic seasons, suggesting a return toward prepandemic seasonality.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Ongoing monitoring of RSV seasonality can guide the timing of immunoprophylaxis and evaluation of new immunization products. Although an eventual return to prepandemic RSV seasonality is expected, clinicians should be aware that off-season RSV circulation might continue.

In the United States, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections cause an estimated 58,000–80,000 hospitalizations among children aged <5 years (1,2) and 60,000–160,000 hospitalizations among adults aged ≥65 years each year (3–5). U.S. RSV epidemics typically follow seasonal patterns, peaking in December or January (6,7), but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted RSV seasonality during 2020–2022 (8). To describe U.S. RSV seasonality during prepandemic and pandemic periods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)* during July 2017–February 2023 were analyzed. Seasonal RSV epidemics were defined as the weeks during which the percentage of PCR test results that were positive for RSV was ≥3% (9). Nationally, prepandemic seasons (2017–2020) began in October, peaked in December, and ended in April. During 2020–21, the typical winter RSV epidemic did not occur. The 2021–22 season began in May, peaked in July, and ended in January. The 2022–23 season started (June) and peaked (November) later than the 2021–22 season, but earlier than prepandemic seasons. In both prepandemic and pandemic periods, epidemics began earlier in Florida and the Southeast and later in regions further north and west. With several RSV prevention products in development,† ongoing monitoring of RSV circulation can guide the timing of RSV immunoprophylaxis and of clinical trials and postlicensure effectiveness studies. Although the timing of the 2022–23 season suggests that seasonal patterns are returning toward those observed in prepandemic years, clinicians should be aware that off-season RSV circulation might continue.
Each week, participating clinical and public health laboratories voluntarily report to NREVSS aggregate numbers of RSV PCR tests performed and numbers of positive test results. Although antigen tests are sometimes performed, this analysis was restricted to PCR tests because they accounted for >90% of tests reported (9). Surveillance years were defined based on troughs in RSV circulation. During 2017–2020 (the prepandemic period), surveillance years began in early July (epidemiologic week 27) and ended the following year in late June (week 26). Because the typical winter RSV epidemic was absent during 2020–21, and the 2021–22 epidemic began in the spring, the 2021–22 and 2022–23 surveillance years (pandemic period) were defined as early March (week 9) to late February (week 8) of the following year.§ Several methods for characterizing RSV seasonality were explored (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126381) (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126380). A 3% test positivity threshold was chosen because it prospectively identified a high proportion of annual RSV detections during epidemic periods of moderate duration. The epidemic onset and offset (or end) weeks were defined, respectively, as the first and last of 2 consecutive weeks when the percentage of PCR tests positive for RSV was ≥3%. The epidemic duration was the inclusive number of weeks between onset and offset. The peak was defined as the week with the highest percentage of PCR tests positive for RSV.
Epidemic onset, offset, peak, and duration were identified for each season at the national level and by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region.¶ Because patterns of weekly RSV circulation in Alaska, Florida, and Hawaii are different from those in other states within their assigned regions (HHS Regions 10, 4, and 9, respectively), these states were excluded from regional analyses. State-level seasonality for Florida is reported; however, an insufficient number of laboratories in Alaska and Hawaii consistently reported PCR data to present state-level seasonality in those states. The analysis included data from laboratories that consistently conducted PCR testing.** This activity was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††
During the period with weeks ending July 8, 2017–February 25, 2023, five distinct RSV epidemics occurred: three before the COVID-19 pandemic (2017–18, 2018–19, and 2019–20) and two during the pandemic (2021–22 and 2022–23). Using the 3% epidemic threshold, no seasonal RSV epidemic was observed to occur during the 2020–21 surveillance year (Figure 1). The number of tests performed increased substantially during the pandemic (Table).
Nationally, RSV epidemics during the 3 surveillance years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (2017–2020) began in October, peaked in December, and lasted a median of 27 weeks before the offset during March–April (Table). In contrast, the 2021–22 epidemic began 21 weeks earlier (May), peaked in July, and lasted 33 weeks until January 2022, although the peak percentage of RSV-positive PCR results (15%) was comparable with that during prepandemic seasons (Figure 1). During the 2022–23 surveillance year, onset occurred in June, the proportion of positive PCR results peaked in November, and the peak was higher (19%) than that during prepandemic seasons (range = 13%–16%). The epidemic lasted 32 weeks until the offset occurred in January.
In both the prepandemic and pandemic periods, RSV epidemics began earliest in Florida and the Southeast and later in regions further north and west (Figure 2). During the Florida prepandemic seasons, the median onset occurred in August, the peak occurred in November, and the epidemic continued until March (median duration = 30 weeks) (Table) (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126382). In the 10 HHS regions (excluding Alaska, Florida, and Hawaii), the median onset ranged from September in Region 4 to December in Region 8. The median epidemic peaks ranged from November in Region 6 to February in Regions 8 and 9. Median offsets ranged from March in Region 5 to May in Region 7; offsets occurred 2–6 weeks earlier during the 2019–20 surveillance year (i.e., when the COVID-19 pandemic began) compared with the preceding 2 surveillance years. The shortest epidemic periods occurred in Region 10 (median = 21 weeks), and the longest occurred in Region 4 (median = 27 weeks).
During the 2021–22 (pandemic) surveillance year, epidemic onsets across the 10 HHS regions and Florida occurred a median of 20 weeks earlier (range = 13–25 weeks) than the median onsets during the prepandemic period (range = March [Florida] to August [Region 10]). Epidemic peaks also occurred earlier than they did during the prepandemic years, ranging from July in Region 6 to December in Region 10. Offsets ranged from November (Region 4) to February (Region 9), which is when prepandemic peaks typically occurred. During the 2021–22 surveillance year, the epidemic durations were a median of 6 weeks longer than the median durations of prepandemic RSV epidemics (range = 21 weeks [Region 2] to 38 weeks [Florida]).
During the 2022–23 season, early epidemic onsets (April–June) were observed in Florida and HHS Regions 3, 4, and 6, but the percentage of RSV-positive PCR test results levelled off before increasing again in September (Figure 1) (Table). In other regions, epidemics began between August and October. Seasons peaked from October in Region 4 to November in regions further north and west (Regions 2, 8, 9, and 10). Epidemics ended between December and February.

Discussion
In the United States, disruption of the seasonal circulation of RSV was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic as nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., school closures and masking) reduced respiratory virus transmission and led to an accumulation of susceptible persons resulting in large epidemics with atypical seasonality (10). After the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions in March 2020, the 2019–20 RSV epidemic ended earlier than the previous two epidemics. During 2020, RSV circulated at historically low levels. In 2021, RSV circulation began earlier (in late spring), when nonpharmaceutical interventions eased, and continued longer than it did during prepandemic years, although the percentage of RSV-positive PCR tests at the peak was comparable to those during prepandemic years. The 2022–23 epidemic began later than the 2021–22 epidemic but earlier than prepandemic epidemics, suggesting a reversion toward prepandemic seasonality with winter peaks. The peak percentage of positive RSV test results was higher than those in previous years, suggesting higher intensity of circulation. Across both prepandemic and pandemic years, RSV circulation began in Florida and the Southeast and later in regions to the north and west. The consistency of this pattern could help predict the timing of future epidemics in specific regions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, reporting to NREVSS is voluntary, and analysis is limited to laboratories that consistently report, which might not represent local and state circulation. Second, differences in testing across regions and changes in testing practices and diagnostics over time, including increased panel testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, could have affected the baseline percentage of positive test results and trends, and thus the onset, offset, and duration of epidemics. Third, there is no standard method for characterizing seasonality; seasonal attributes vary depending on the method used. An earlier description of RSV seasonality in the United States used a more sensitive method (retrospective slope 10§§) that can only be applied retrospectively and results in longer epidemic durations (6,9). However, the 3% RSV-positive PCR threshold used in the current analysis can be applied in near real time and identified epidemic periods that included a high concentration of detections (9). Finally, this analysis describes regional and national trends; locally available data and region-specific thresholds might better reflect circulation patterns within specific jurisdictions.
Although the peak in RSV circulation during November 2022 suggests that seasonal patterns are returning to those observed in prepandemic years, it is uncertain whether this reversion will continue in the upcoming surveillance year. To monitor RSV circulation, CDC has conducted year-round surveillance using a variety of approaches including active, population-based surveillance for RSV-associated hospitalizations and outpatient visits.¶¶ Clinicians should be aware that atypical RSV epidemics might continue and consider testing patients for multiple respiratory pathogens when indicated. With new prevention products nearing licensure, including vaccines for older adults, maternal vaccines, and long-acting RSV immunoprophylaxis for infants and children, policy makers should consider RSV seasonality when making recommendations about the timing of studies and administration of new immunization and other RSV prevention products.

§ Defining surveillance year start and end dates based on troughs in RSV activity ensures that seasonal epidemics are encompassed in a 12-month period and that calculated proportions of annual detections that occur in the epidemic period are comparable over time (i.e., that the denominator for the proportion is the 12-month period between troughs in RSV circulation).

§§ Retrospective slope 10 is a method for retrospectively characterizing RSV seasons that captures a high percentage of PCR detections. It uses a centered 5-week moving average of RSV detections normalized to a season peak of 1,000 detections. The season onset is defined as the second of 2 consecutive weeks when the slope, or normalized 5-week moving average of RSV detections between subsequent weeks, exceeds 10. The season offset is the last week when the standardized (normalized) detections exceed the standardized detections at onset.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
U.S. hepatitis A incidence has been increasing since 2016.
What is added by this report?
In 2021, a hepatitis A outbreak in Virginia traced to an unvaccinated food handler resulted in 51 cases, 31 hospitalizations, and three deaths. As of September 30, 2022, an additional 98 community hepatitis A cases had been reported in the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Public health partnerships with businesses and other community partners (e.g., harm reduction programs) might increase hepatitis A vaccination among persons at risk for this infection, while also reducing the stigmatization of hepatitis A-associated risk factors.

Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV); it is transmitted through ingestion of food or drink that has been contaminated by small amounts of infected stool, or through direct contact, including sexual contact, with a person who is infected (1). After years of historically low rates of hepatitis A in the United States, the incidence began increasing in 2016, with outbreaks characterized by person-to-person HAV transmission among persons who use drugs, persons experiencing homelessness, and men who have sex with men (2,3). As of September 2022, 13 states were experiencing outbreaks, including Virginia (3). In September 2021, the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts (RCAHD) in southwestern Virginia investigated an outbreak of hepatitis A. The outbreak, which resulted in 51 cases, 31 hospitalizations, and three deaths, was associated with a food handler who was infected. After the outbreak, the community experienced ongoing person-to-person transmission of HAV, predominantly among persons who use injection drugs. As of September 30, 2022,* an additional 98 cases had been reported to RCAHD. The initial outbreak and community transmission have exceeded US$3 million in estimated direct costs (4,5). This report describes the initial outbreak and the ongoing community transmission of HAV. Increasing vaccination coverage among persons with risk factors for hepatitis A infection is important, including among those who use drugs. Strengthening community partnerships between public health officials and organizations that employ persons with risk factors for acquisition of HAV could help to prevent infections and outbreaks.
Top
Initial Outbreak Investigation (September–November 2021)
RCAHD serves a population of approximately 280,000 persons. The districts have previously experienced a low hepatitis A incidence, with only six cases reported during January 1, 2019–December 31, 2020, and none through August 2021. In mid-September 2021, however, five hepatitis A cases were reported during a single week. Initial case investigations identified a local restaurant chain as a common source of exposure. Further investigation identified the index patient as an unvaccinated food handler who had risk factors for hepatitis A and who had worked at three locations of the same restaurant chain; however, this person delayed seeking medical attention for more than 2 weeks after symptom onset and did not disclose being employed as a food handler at that time. Based on the index patient’s symptom onset date and last day worked, the exposure period for patrons who ate at any of the three restaurants was determined to be August 10–26, 2021. When the outbreak investigation was closed on November 20, 2021, 51 restaurant-associated cases had been identified (Figure).† The median patient age was 64 years (range = 30–86 years) (Table).
Top
Sustained Community Transmission (Ongoing)
In October 2021, RCAHD began to receive reports of hepatitis A cases that were not directly associated with the index patient or restaurant outbreak. By the end of 2021, 13 additional cases were reported to RCAHD. Sustained community transmission continued into 2022, with 98 total cases reported through September 2022, including 64 hospitalizations (Figure). An identical genotype IB sequence was identified in eight of the nine specimens submitted from the restaurant outbreak and from all five sequenced community case specimens.
Although a clear temporal association between the restaurant outbreak and two of the community cases was demonstrated, limited contact information for most of the persons with community-acquired cases hampered the ability to conclusively identify an epidemiologic link between the restaurant outbreak and sustained person-to-person community transmission. Among the 98 cases, only 40 (40.8%) patients were interviewed by public health officials, either because of insufficient contact information (57) or refusal to be interviewed (one). Public health officials conducted a comprehensive medical record review of all cases to identify patient risk factors, contacts, and exposures. Among persons with community-acquired cases, the most commonly identified hepatitis A risk factors were any drug use (85.7%) (including injection drug use [74.5%]) and experiencing homelessness (12.2%) (Table).
Top
Public Health Response
When the restaurant chain was identified as a common risk during the initial outbreak, RCAHD’s environmental health specialists performed risk assessments at each site and determined that the index patient had ungloved-hand contact with ready-to-eat foods while infectious. RCAHD personnel worked with the restaurant’s management and the state health department to coordinate risk communication.§ The first press release was issued on September 24, 2021, recommending that persons with symptoms consistent with hepatitis A seek medical care. Because restaurant exposure was identified outside the 2-week period during which postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin is recommended, PEP was not advised for the public. Although RCAHD encouraged and facilitated hepatitis A vaccination for employees of the affected restaurants and close contacts of patients, including providing on-site vaccinations, fewer than 20% of eligible employees were vaccinated.
Similar public health responses were implemented in 2022 when three hepatitis A cases were diagnosed in local restaurant workers. Throughout 2022, RCAHD partnered with community-based organizations to increase education about hepatitis A and access to the hepatitis A vaccine for persons at risk for acquiring HAV. By September 30, 2022, >2,500 hepatitis A vaccine doses had been administered through these efforts.
The financial toll of these outbreaks has exceeded US$3 million in estimated direct costs for hospitalizations ($16,232 per hospitalization), one liver transplant ($1,427,805), and hepatitis A vaccines¶ (4,5). This estimate does not include indirect costs such as personnel costs or missed wages for patients (4,5).
Top
Discussion
In hepatitis A outbreaks, rapid source identification is critical to interrupting transmission. In this outbreak, RCAHD quickly identified the source; however, because of the long incubation period (15–50 days), a delay in the index patient’s seeking medical attention, and that person not disclosing their occupation during the initial interview, widespread transmission, resulting in 51 cases, 31 hospitalizations, and three deaths, had already occurred. The severity of outcomes associated with the restaurant-associated outbreak was likely due to a combination of the high median patient age and prevalence of comorbidities.
The unvaccinated index patient in this outbreak had risk factors for which hepatitis A vaccine is routinely recommended. Hepatitis A vaccines are safe and effective and became part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule in 2006 (6). Current adult vaccination recommendations focus on “any person who requests vaccination” (7) and disproportionately affected populations that include persons who use drugs, men who have sex with men, persons experiencing homelessness, and international travelers. In the United States during 2011–2016, approximately two thirds of persons who reported injection drug use (67%) and men who have sex with men (64%) reported that they had not been vaccinated against hepatitis A (8).
Despite the association of drug use with widespread U.S. hepatitis A outbreaks, vaccination efforts targeting persons who use drugs is challenging for many reasons, including behavioral health issues, limited engagement in health care systems, and transportation problems (9). A 2013 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration study found that, among industries, the restaurant industry had the highest rates of drug use, with nearly 20% of food service workers reporting drug use during the preceding month (10). In 2019, the U.S. food industry employed 15.3 million persons, suggesting that nearly 3 million food industry workers might be using drugs.** To improve hepatitis A vaccination coverage among persons who use drugs, public health agencies can explore partnerships with businesses that might employ persons at higher risk for hepatitis A. Persons who use drugs might not disclose being in a high-risk category recommended for hepatitis A vaccination, but might consider vaccination if encouraged by their employer. Health care professionals and public health officials should continue to encourage vaccination among disproportionately affected populations.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the initial outbreak began during the COVID-19 Delta variant surge, and community transmission of HAV continued during the Omicron variant surge. Pandemic-related response activities in the community might have resulted in underreporting of cases. Second, extensive media coverage of the hepatitis A outbreak might have increased hepatitis A testing in the community, leading to more diagnoses of cases not associated with the outbreak. Third, RCAHD encountered challenges to interviewing patients, which could have resulted in underreporting of risk factors, epidemiologic links, and specific symptoms. This underreporting limited RCAHD’s ability to identify direct epidemiologic linkages between restaurant-associated cases and subsequent community transmission. Finally, because the specific genotype IB sequence identified in these outbreaks is not uncommon, a causal association between the restaurant outbreak and the ongoing person-to-person transmission could not be established.
After years of limited HAV transmission in the Roanoke, Virginia area, hepatitis A cases increased sharply in the community following an initial outbreak associated with an unvaccinated food handler with hepatitis A risk factors. Increasing awareness of risk factors for hepatitis A, particularly among food handlers, and increasing vaccine access for persons at risk, particularly those who use drugs, could help prevent similar outbreaks in other communities.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) can emerge and cause paralysis in areas with low population immunity to polioviruses.
What is added by this report?
During January 2021–December 2022, 76 cVDPV type 2 outbreaks occurred in 42 countries. Since 2020, the numbers of paralytic cases and new emergences have declined following the introduction of a safer novel type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine for outbreak control. The number of cVDPV type 1 outbreaks increased during 2021–2022 as COVID-19 pandemic–associated global routine immunization coverage declined.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Improving routine immunization coverage, strengthening poliovirus surveillance, and conducting timely and high-quality supplementary immunization activity responses to cVDPV outbreaks in 2023 are necessary to stop cVDPV transmission.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks* can occur when oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV, containing one or more Sabin-strain serotypes 1, 2, and 3) strains undergo prolonged circulation in under-vaccinated populations, resulting in genetically reverted neurovirulent virus (1,2). Following declaration of the eradication of wild poliovirus type 2 in 2015 and the global synchronized switch from trivalent OPV (tOPV, containing Sabin-strain types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV, containing types 1 and 3 only) for routine immunization activities† in April 2016 (3), cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks have been reported worldwide (4). During 2016–2020, immunization responses to cVDPV2 outbreaks required use of Sabin-strain monovalent OPV2, but new VDPV2 emergences could occur if campaigns did not reach a sufficiently high proportion of children. Novel oral poliovirus vaccine type 2 (nOPV2), a more genetically stable vaccine than Sabin OPV2, was developed to address the risk for reversion to neurovirulence and became available in 2021. Because of the predominant use of nOPV2 during the reporting period, supply replenishment has frequently been insufficient for prompt response campaigns (5). This report describes global cVDPV outbreaks during January 2021–December 2022 (as of February 14, 2023) and updates previous reports (4). During 2021–2022, there were 88 active cVDPV outbreaks, including 76 (86%) caused by cVDPV2. cVDPV outbreaks affected 46 countries, 17 (37%) of which reported their first post-switch cVDPV2 outbreak. The total number of paralytic cVDPV cases during 2020–2022 decreased by 36%, from 1,117 to 715; however, the proportion of all cVDPV cases that were caused by cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) increased from 3% in 2020 to 18% in 2022, including the occurrence of cocirculating cVDPV1 and cVDPV2 outbreaks in two countries. The increased proportion of cVDPV1 cases follows a substantial decrease in global routine immunization coverage and suspension of preventive immunization campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022) (6); outbreak responses in some countries were also suboptimal. Improving routine immunization coverage, strengthening poliovirus surveillance, and conducting timely and high-quality supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in response to cVDPV outbreaks are needed to interrupt cVDPV transmission and reach the goal of no cVDPV isolations in 2024.

cVDPV Outbreaks
Poliovirus outbreaks are considered interrupted by the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on International Poliovirus Transmission when ≥13 months have passed since the onset of paralysis in the latest case or isolation sample date (4). A total of 172 cVDPV outbreaks have been reported since 2016, 88 (51%) of which were active during 2021–2022 (Table 1). Among these, transmission was interrupted in 38 (42%) active outbreaks (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126383). This report does not describe 84 (49%) cVDPV outbreaks in which transmission was interrupted before 2021.
Top
cVDPV1 Outbreaks
Since 2016, 14 cVDPV1 outbreaks from 12 emergences§ have been reported across 10 countries. Nine of these 14 outbreaks were active in five countries (Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, and Yemen) during 2021–2022, including five new cVDPV1 outbreaks detected in four countries (DRC, Madagascar, Malawi, and Mozambique) (Table 1) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126383). During 2022, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance detected 127 paralytic cases, representing a 263% increase from 35 in 2020 and a 694% increase from 16 in 2021.
Since September 2020, Madagascar has experienced ongoing cVDPV1 transmission, with 13 cases detected during 2021 and 2022. Among three outbreaks active during 2021 (MAD-SUO-1, MAD-SUE-1, and MAD-ANO-1), the latest detection in the MAD-SUO-1 outbreak occurred in February 2021) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126383) (4). An additional emergence (MAD-ANO-2) was confirmed in February 2022. DRC detected two cVDPV1 outbreaks in 2022 (RDC-TAN-1 in September and RDC-HLO-3 in November), totaling 91 cases by December and accounting for 72% of the global cVDPV1 cases in 2022. DRC also has concurrent cVDPV2 outbreaks.
In Mozambique, the first identified patient in the MOZ-NPL-2 emergence outbreak had paralysis onset in July 2020 (at that time an unclassified VDPV1 case); after the identification of additional genetically linked cases, an outbreak was confirmed in July 2022. Genomic sequence analysis indicated that the emergence had occurred approximately 4 years before the first detection, indicating substantial gaps in poliovirus surveillance (7). The MOZ-NPL-2 emergence spread to Malawi, where circulation was identified in September 2022 (8). Mozambique also has a concurrent wild poliovirus type 1 outbreak linked to Malawi (9). The latest detection of transmission of the Yemen outbreak (YEM-SAD-1 emergence) was in January 2021 (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126383).

cVDPV2 Outbreaks
As of December 31, 2022, and since August 2016, a total of 154 cVDPV2 outbreaks from 82 cVDPV2 emergences have been reported in 48 countries. Seventeen (35%) countries reported their first post-switch cVDPV2 emergences and outbreaks in 2021 (eight) and 2022 (nine). Of the 82 emergences detected, 42 (51%) were active during 2021–2022, including nine (11%) new emergences identified in 2021 and five (6%) in 2022 (Table 1). Thirteen (16%) of all 82 emergences spread outside the country of first detection. The NIE-JIS-1 emergence, first detected in January 2018 in Nigeria, has spread to 18 other African countries; active transmission occurred in 13 of those countries during the reporting period. The NIE-ZAS-1 emergence, originally detected in Nigeria in July 2020, has been detected in an additional 12 countries since 2021. The YEM-TAI-1 emergence, first detected in Yemen in 2021, has spread into Egypt and Somalia, and the SOM-BAN-1 emergence group, first detected in Somalia in October 2017, continues to circulate only in that country (4).
Among the 154 cVDPV2 outbreaks that have occurred since the 2016 global synchronized switch from tOPV to bOPV for routine immunization, 76 (49%) were active across 42 countries during the reporting period (Figure). Forty-nine (65%) of the active outbreaks across 35 countries were first reported during 2021–2022 (Table 1). Even as cVDPV2 outbreaks have spread, the reported number of paralytic cases has declined from the peak in 2020: 587 paralytic cVDPV2 cases were reported in 2022 (as of February 14, 2023), representing a 14% decrease from 682 in 2021 and a 46% decrease from 1,082 cases in 2020. However, 2022 case counts could ultimately match or surpass 2021 counts as samples collected from the end of 2022 are processed. In 34 (45%) of the 76 active outbreaks, the latest detections occurred ≥13 months earlier, and transmission in those outbreaks is considered interrupted (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126383).
Among the 49 new cVDPV2 outbreaks that occurred during the reporting period, 33 occurred in 23 countries in the WHO African Region (AFR), and 10 new outbreaks occurred in six countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Nine countries (Algeria, Botswana, Eritrea, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal, South Sudan, and Uganda) in AFR and two (Djibouti and Yemen) in EMR reported their first post-switch cVDPV2 outbreaks during this period. Among the 41 cVDPV2 outbreaks that were active at the end of the reporting period, 27 (66%) were in 19 AFR countries and nine (22%) were in five EMR countries (Table 1). In 2022, cVDPV2 cases from outbreaks in two countries (DRC [AFR] and Yemen [EMR]) represented 75% of all type 2 cases reported. The DRC reported 283 cases, an increase of 911% from the 28 cases reported in 2021, representing 48% of global cVDPV2 cases. Yemen reported an increase of 142%, from 66 cases in 2021 to 160 cases in 2022, accounting for 27% of global cVDPV2 cases in 2022.
The PAK-GB-1 emergence detected in Pakistan in 2019 spread to Tajikistan in 2020 and subsequently to Ukraine, with two cases identified during October–December 2021 (4,6). In 2022, genetically related VDPV2 detections (IUUC-2022) were reported in Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States (New York) (10). One polio case and 12 environmental surveillance (ES) isolations were reported in the United States, five nonpatient isolations in the United Kingdom, and one nonpatient isolation in Israel. In Indonesia, a new cVDPV2 outbreak (INO-ACE-1) with one case was reported in November 2022. Genetic sequencing analysis suggested the emergence strain had been circulating undetected for approximately 3 years.
Top
cVDPV type 3 (cVDPV3) Outbreaks
Four cVDPV3 outbreaks from different emergences have occurred since 2016, two of which were active during the reporting period. One outbreak was in Israel (cVDPV3-ISR) during 2021–2022, with one paralytic case, and one in the Palestinian Territories (cVDPV3) in 2022, with 16 ES detections (Table 1).
Top
Outbreak Control
Of the 172 cVDPV outbreaks reported since 2016, 121 (70%) have been interrupted. A current critical measure of outbreak response performance for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is the interruption of virus transmission in outbreaks (i.e., the latest detection) within 120 days of the outbreak notification date (1). As of February 14, 2023, 19 of 29 (66%) outbreaks confirmed in 2021 had no virus detected after 120 days, compared with 28 (62%) of 45 outbreaks in 2019 and 27 (54%) of 50 in 2020 (Table 2).
Top
Discussion
GPEI’s 2022–2026 strategic plan includes the goal of stopping all cVDPV outbreaks by the end of 2023. Ongoing global cVDPV2 transmission and an increasing number of cVDPV1 outbreaks, with cocirculation of cVDPV1 and cVDPV2 in two countries, threaten the attainment of this target (1). Although the number of cVDPV2 cases and of new reported emergences have decreased during 2021 and 2022, two major challenges to reaching the target remain: 1) achieving high-quality surveillance that detects poliovirus in a timely manner, and 2) implementing fully effective outbreak control measures that prevent international spread. Wide gaps in poliovirus surveillance led to late detection of some countries’ outbreaks (e.g., MOZ-NPL-2), inferred by the extent of the genetic divergence of the initial isolates.
The number of paralytic cVDPV2 cases reported in 2022 represents a 46% decrease from the peak number in 2020 (4,9). During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March–June 2020), polio outbreak response SIAs were postponed. Most SIAs during the successive months of the reporting period were either delayed or of poor quality, resulting in the detection of breakthrough¶ cVDPV viruses in many outbreaks (2,4). The proportion of outbreaks controlled within 120 days has not substantially changed from that during previous years.
The decrease in number of new cVDPV2 emergences during this period is likely associated with the use of nOPV2 for outbreak response campaigns. Since the first cVDPV2 outbreak response using nOPV2 under the WHO Emergency Use Listing in March 2021 (as of March 2023), >590 million nOPV2 doses** have been administered in 24 countries (5). Whereas the number of cVDPV2 emergences has declined during the 2021–2022 COVID-19 pandemic and recovery period, international spread has not. During the last 2 years, 17 countries have experienced their first post-switch cVDPV2 outbreaks, reflecting poor outbreak control in the country of origin.
In 2022, the number of new cVDPV1 outbreaks increased substantially and primarily affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Routine immunization coverage, which was already low in many subnational areas of outbreak countries, decreased after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the suspension of preventive bOPV SIAs has resulted in an environment with increased susceptibility to the emergence of cVDPV1 outbreaks (6). During 2022, in AFR countries, the national proportion of children who received their third dose of polio vaccine (Pol3) by age 1 year was 70%, compared with 74% in 2019; Pol3 coverage in EMR was 83% both years (6). Increasing routine immunization coverage will be critical for preventing paralysis and aiding in the interruption of global cVDPV1 transmission.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, delays in shipment and testing of poliovirus surveillance specimens by regional or international reference laboratories might have resulted in delays in detection of emergences and of additional cases during the second half of 2022. Second, surveillance gaps might have resulted in underestimates of poliovirus cases and the extent of transmission.
Countries responding to cVDPV outbreaks face multiple challenges in implementing effective outbreak responses, including delays in outbreak detection and receipt of vaccine, resulting in substantial transmission before implementation of response SIAs. Countries face competing public health priorities (e.g., outbreaks of measles, cholera, and Ebola virus disease), security challenges, and other national priorities with limited resources, which can negatively affect the overall quality and timeliness of outbreak response SIAs. Recent limitations of sufficient nOPV2 availability have hampered timely SIAs in response to cVPDV2 outbreaks. Thus, improving routine immunization coverage, especially at subnational levels, strengthening poliovirus surveillance, and conducting timely and high-quality outbreak response SIAs will be critical to interrupt cVDPV transmission in outbreaks and reach GPEI’s goal of no cVDPV isolations in 2024.

* By genomic sequence analysis of the region encoding capsid viral protein 1 (VP1), a poliovirus with >1% divergence from the parent Sabin strain for serotypes 1 and 3, or >0.6% for serotype 2 is classified as a VDPV. Evidence of circulation (i.e., a cVDPV outbreak) occurs when two or more independent detections of genetically linked VDPVs are identified through AFP surveillance, environmental surveillance, or from healthy community members.
† In April 2016, all OPV-using countries withdrew tOPV from routine immunization activities and switched to bOPV. Each OPV serotype induced protection against paralysis and poliovirus transmission. Monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2), tOPV (when there is cocirculation), and novel OPV type 2 (nOPV2) are reserved for use in cVDPV2 outbreak response SIA. At least 1 dose of injectable inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is included in routine immunization. IPV induces production of antibodies that protect a person against paralysis from all three poliovirus serotypes, but it does not stop poliovirus transmission.
§ VDPV emergences are defined by shared genetic changes in the VP1 capsid region from the parental OPV strain, not genetically related to previous VDPV detections. If an emergence group poliovirus is imported into other countries identified by one or more detections, those are considered additional outbreaks.
¶ Breakthrough transmission is defined as detection of a poliovirus (wild poliovirus or cVDPV) in samples from a patient with AFP, a healthy child, or environmental sampling sites with the date of onset of paralysis (for AFP cases) or the date of sample collection (for healthy children or environmental samples) >21 days after the first day of the last SIA in an area where at least two SIAs have been implemented.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
To reduce school transmission of SARS-CoV-2, K–12 public school districts implemented ventilation improvements (replacing or upgrading ventilation systems, installing filtration systems, installing ultraviolet germicidal irradiation devices, or improving airflow). Federal funding remains available for ventilation upgrades.
What is added by this report?
None of the ventilation strategies examined was reported by >51% of school districts. Implementation of ventilation improvements varied by school district U.S. Census Bureau region, geographic locale, and poverty level. High-poverty school districts reported implementation of the highest percentage of strategies.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Many public school districts have not taken steps to improve school building ventilation. Equitable access and support might be needed to assist school districts in their efforts to prevent respiratory infections through ventilation improvements.

Improving ventilation has been one of several COVID-19 prevention strategies implemented by kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12) schools to stay open for safe in-person learning. Because transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through inhalation of infectious viral particles, it is important to reduce the concentration of and exposure time to infectious aerosols (1–3). CDC examined reported ventilation improvement strategies among U.S. K–12 public school districts using telephone survey data collected during August–December 2022. Maintaining continuous airflow through school buildings during active hours was the most frequently reported strategy by school districts (50.7%); 33.9% of school districts reported replacement or upgrade of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; 28.0% reported installation or use of in-room air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters; and 8.2% reported installation of ultraviolet (UV) germicidal irradiation (UVGI) devices, which use UV light to kill airborne pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. School districts in National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) city locales, the West U.S. Census Bureau region, and those designated by U.S. Census Bureau Small Area Income Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) as high-poverty districts reported the highest percentages of HVAC system upgrades and HEPA-filtered in-room air cleaner use, although 28%–60% of all responses were unknown or missing. Federal funding remains available to school districts to support ventilation improvements. Public health departments can encourage K–12 school officials to use available funding to improve ventilation and help reduce transmission of respiratory diseases in K–12 settings.
MCH Strategic Data (MCH), a private company offering educational, health care, and government data and technology solutions, repeatedly surveyed school district office staff members by telephone during August 8–December 29, 2022, regarding implementation of COVID-19 prevention policies and strategies, including ventilation improvements. Ventilation strategies examined included replacing or upgrading HVAC systems; using in-room air cleaners with HEPA filters; installing UVGI in high-risk areas; and maintaining continuous movement of air supply or airflow through school buildings during active hours, including opening windows and doors, using fans, or adjusting thermostats or central controls.* School districts were asked, “Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which of the following steps to increase ventilation or filter/clean air apply to most schools (at least 50%) in your district?”
MCH attempted to contact 15,871 U.S. K–12 public and public charter school districts† (estimated student enrollment = 52,696,479) at a cadence based on district enrollment size, whereby larger school districts (those with 2,500 or more students) were surveyed weekly, and districts with less than 2,500 students were surveyed biweekly. The most recent response from school districts was included for analysis. Individual school-level enrollment was summed for each district.
Although 1,358 independent charter school districts were surveyed, they were excluded from this analysis because SAIPE school district data were not available for these districts. Descriptive analyses summarizing responses to ventilation questions are presented for the overall sample and stratified by U.S. Census Bureau region,§ NCES locale,¶ and poverty level. Poverty levels were based on the 2021 SAIPE for school-aged children living in poverty** as the percentage of children and adolescents aged 5–17 years experiencing poverty within a school district, grouped into tertiles. Responses were grouped into three categories: 1) school districts in which strategies were completed, in progress, or being done by most schools; 2) those in which they were not being done by most schools, no action had been taken, or the response was not applicable; and 3) unknown or missing. Analyses were conducted using R (version 1.4.1106; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††
A total of 8,410 school districts (64.2%) representing an estimated 61.7% of enrolled public school students responded to ventilation-related questions (Table 1). Among responding school districts and national K–12 public school districts,§§ most (53%) were classified as rural, and the largest percentage (37%) were in the Midwest region. Responding school districts were similar to all U.S. K–12 public school districts in terms of U.S. Census Bureau region, locale, and poverty level distributions. Among the four ventilation improvements examined, maintaining continuous airflow in classrooms was reported by just over one half (50.7%) of school districts; one third (33.9%) reported having HVAC system improvements in progress or completed, more than one quarter (28.0%) reported planned or completed use of HEPA-filtered in-room air cleaners, and 8.2% reported UVGI improvements planned or completed in most schools (Table 2). The use of HEPA-filtered in-room air cleaners was also more frequently reported by districts in cities (33.1%) than in those in suburban (29.9%), town (27.4%), and rural (26.9%) districts. UVGI improvements were reported less frequently overall, and by 8.9% of rural school districts, followed by 8.4% of city, 8.0% of town, and 6.6% of suburban districts.
By U.S. Census Bureau region, districts in the West more frequently reported continuous airflow (60.2%), HVAC (40.0%), and in-room air cleaners with HEPA filters (41.6%) ventilation improvements in most schools than did those in the Northeast (53.6%, 32.8%, and 26.8%, respectively), Midwest (46.5%, 32.3%, and 22.7%, respectively), and South (46.1%, 32.1%, and 25.6%, respectively). UVGI improvements were more commonly reported by school districts in the South (10.6%) than by those in West (9.1%), Midwest (7.1%), and Northeast (6.1%) regions. High-poverty school districts more frequently reported each of the four ventilation improvements in most schools than did low- and mid-poverty school districts, with 51.8% reporting maintaining continuous airflow, 35.1% reporting HVAC, 29.9% reporting HEPA-filtered in-room air cleaners, and 10.6% reporting UVGI improvements. For all possible interventions, unknown or missing responses accounted for 28%–60% of responses.

Discussion
This report highlights four strategies public school districts have used to reduce transmission of respiratory infections through improved ventilation and facilitate safe in-school learning (4), as well as differences in strategy used by U.S. Census Bureau region, NCES locale, and school district poverty level. The most frequently reported ventilation strategy, maintaining continuous movement of airflow in school buildings, was also the least expensive to implement and was reported by approximately one half of school districts. More costly strategies such as installation and use of in-room air cleaners with HEPA filters and installation of UVGI were less frequently reported. That none of the four ventilation strategies was reported by more than approximately one half of school districts underscores the ongoing opportunity to improve indoor air quality among K–12 school buildings in the United States. CDC guidance for COVID-19 prevention to support safe in-person learning and improving ventilation in buildings, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Indoor Air Quality Guide for Schools kit highlight various ways to improve ventilation, such as regular air filter replacement and moving barriers that might interfere with airflow (1,5,6).
Rural school districts less frequently reported replacing or upgrading HVAC systems and using HEPA-filtered in-room air cleaners than did school districts in other locales. This difference might be due to limitations in resource availability and difficulty finding contractors available and willing to complete capital improvements (7). In addition, rural schools might be more likely to use natural ventilation, such as opening windows, than are suburban and city schools because of less exposure to noise and air pollution in rural areas or simply having windows that can be opened. This finding is supported by an early 2022 report which found that lower-cost strategies were more frequently reported by schools overall, with rural schools least likely to report implementing resource-intensive ventilation strategies (8). School districts in the West region were more likely to report replacing or upgrading HVAC systems than were those in the Northeast, Midwest, and South regions, possibly because the buildings were newer and more amenable to implementation of technological improvements compared with older buildings in other regions. High-poverty school districts more frequently implemented all ventilation strategies compared with mid- and low-poverty school districts; these districts might have been prioritized and might have more experience applying for federal funding. A recent report found that high-poverty schools were more likely to use federal funds to undertake ventilation improvements (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, because ventilation strategies were reported by school district administrative staff members, responses might be influenced by respondents’ level of awareness of ventilation strategies used within their district. Limited awareness might be reflected by the high percentage of unknown responses to survey questions, resulting in a likely underreporting of ventilation improvements implemented. Second, these data were captured at the school district level. School-level variation in implementation of ventilation strategies within school districts might exist, but was not able to be examined. Third, strategies examined were not exhaustive, and school districts might have implemented additional improvements that were not identified by this survey. Fourth, although this study used a census-based approach to survey all U.S. K–12 public school districts, systematic differences between participating and nonparticipating schools could have affected the representativeness of these data; however, the distribution of participating school districts by U.S. Census Bureau region, NCES locale, and poverty level was similar to that of all U.S. K–12 public school districts. Fifth, without knowledge of the baseline ventilation status of participating school districts, a complete assessment of ventilation improvements was not possible. Finally, energy consumption before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was not evaluated as a means to measure the expense of adjusting thermostats and central controls to school districts.
Substantial federal funding remains available for ventilation improvements in school buildings that have been shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission¶¶ (4). Such improvements are part of a multicomponent approach to enhancing the school environment and could have benefits for COVID-19 and other airborne infectious disease prevention. Ventilation improvements can also reduce asthma exacerbations and allergy symptoms and have been linked to better academic outcomes for students (9); such improvements might also protect schools from extreme weather events, which have been shown to result in approximately one third of unplanned school closures that result in transition to remote learning (10), highlighting a need for adequate heating and cooling in school buildings as seasons change. Ventilation improvements can improve infectious and noninfectious disease outcomes for students and staff members (4,10).
Combined with staying current with COVID-19 vaccinations, staying home when sick, practicing proper hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette (including masking when appropriate), ventilation is part of a comprehensive approach to reducing COVID-19 spread and maintaining safe, in-person learning. Public health and education professionals can support districts in undertaking ventilation improvements now that might lead to far-reaching improvements among a variety of student and staff member health outcomes. Ensuring equitable access to resources, support, and other facilitators of ventilation improvements is important given identified geographic and socioeconomic disparities.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Prescriptions for stimulants, primarily used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), were increasing for adults before the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies enacted during the pandemic expanded access to prescription stimulants via telehealth.
What is added by this report?
The percentage of adolescent and adult females and adult males receiving prescription stimulant fills increased during 2016–2021, particularly during 2020–2021.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Growing recognition of ADHD in adults and increases in prescription stimulant fills raise questions about current adult ADHD care. Development of clinical recommendations for diagnosing and managing adult ADHD could help guide safe and appropriate stimulant prescribing. Evaluation of policies enacted during the pandemic could identify benefits and harms of those policies.

Prescription stimulant use, primarily for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has increased among adults in the United States during recent decades, while remaining stable or declining among children and adolescents (1,2). MarketScan commercial claims data were analyzed to describe trends in prescription stimulant fills before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2016–2021) by calculating annual percentages of enrollees aged 5–64 years in employer-sponsored health plans who had one or more prescription stimulant fills overall and by sex and age group. Overall, the percentage of enrollees with one or more prescription stimulant fills increased from 3.6% in 2016 to 4.1% in 2021. The percentages of females aged 15–44 years and males aged 25–44 years with prescription stimulant fills increased by more than 10% during 2020–2021. Future evaluation could determine if policy and health system reimbursement changes enacted during the pandemic contributed to the increase in stimulant prescriptions. Stimulants can offer substantial benefits for persons with ADHD, but also pose potential harms, including adverse effects, medication interactions, diversion and misuse, and overdoses. Well-established clinical guidelines exist for ADHD care, but only for children and adolescents* (3); clinical practice guidelines for adult ADHD could help adults also receive accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment.
CDC analyzed claims data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, a national convenience sample of deidentified health care claims from enrollees in employer-sponsored insurance plans. CDC accessed 2016–2021 MarketScan data using Treatment Pathways 4.0, an online analytic platform that includes plans with complete data on prescription drug fills, to calculate the annual percentages of persons continuously enrolled throughout the calendar year with one or more prescription stimulant† fills. All prescription stimulants were included in the analyses, regardless of whether the enrollee had any claims with an ADHD diagnosis code present. Percentages and annual percent change (APC) were calculated for enrollees aged 5–64 years overall and by sex and age group; primary results were calculated by 5-year age groups, but some results were summarized by wider age groups to describe broader patterns. Among persons with one or more prescription stimulant fills during the calendar year, the mean number of prescription stimulant fills during that year and the percentage of persons who met a case definition for receipt of care for ADHD§ were calculated. Statistical testing was not performed because the size of the MarketScan database often results in significant p-values that are not clinically meaningful. All point estimates are presented, and changes >10% are highlighted. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶
Across all years, the percentages of male and female enrollees with one or more prescription stimulant fills were highest among those aged 5–19 and 15–24 years, respectively. Overall, the percentage of enrollees with prescription stimulant fills increased from 3.6% in 2016 to 4.1% in 2021, with percentages and APC varying by sex and age (Table) (Figure 1) (Figure 2). During 2016–2020, percentages remained stable or decreased among females aged ≤24 years (average APC range = −1.8% to 0.1%) and increased modestly among those aged 25–64 years (average APC range = 2.3% to 6.6%). However, during 2020–2021, the percentage of females with one or more prescription stimulant fills increased substantially among most age groups, with the largest changes among those aged 15–44 and 50–54 years (APC range = 14.3% to 19.2%).
During 2016–2020, the pattern among males was similar to that among comparably aged females: the percentage with prescription stimulant fills decreased slightly among those aged ≤24 years (average APC range = –3.8% to –1.7%) and remained stable or increased modestly among those aged ≥25 years (average APC range = 0% to 6.5%). During 2020–2021, the percentage of males with prescription fills decreased among those aged ≤19 years and increased substantially among those aged 25–44 years and 50–54 years (APC range = 11.1% to 14.7%).
Among persons with one or more prescription stimulant fills, the annual mean number of fills ranged from 7.4 to 7.6 (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/125800). Most persons aged 5–19 years (≥75%) and adults aged 20–64 years (53%–77%) with one or more prescription stimulant fills met the case definition for receipt of ADHD care in the preceding or current calendar year; these percentages were relatively stable during the study period (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/125800).

Discussion
The percentage of persons with employer-sponsored insurance who received prescription stimulants increased during 2016–2021, with notable increases among adolescent and adult females and adult males. The largest single-year increases occurred during 2020–2021, with the annual change exceeding 10% in many age groups. Consistently across the study period, most persons with prescription stimulant fills had health care encounters with ADHD diagnosis codes, and persons with prescription stimulant fills averaged more than seven fills per year, suggesting that most were receiving ongoing care for ADHD.
During this study period, the highest percentages of stimulant prescriptions were among males aged 5–19 years, although these percentages decreased over time. Historically, ADHD has been defined as a childhood disorder more common among boys (3), but it is increasingly recognized as a potentially lifelong condition that might be underdiagnosed or undertreated in both girls and adults (3,4). Appropriate diagnosis and effective treatment can help improve functioning for persons with ADHD (3); prescription stimulants have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adults (3,4).
The prevalence of diagnosed ADHD and associated treatment in adults has increased in recent decades (1,2,5). The current study adds to evidence** that the increasing trend in the percentage of adults receiving prescriptions for stimulants has continued during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a notable upturn during 2020–2021. The pandemic has had negative impacts on mental health (6,7), which might have led to or exacerbated ADHD symptoms. To adapt to the pandemic environment, policy and health system reimbursement changes were implemented, such as expansion of telehealth and easing of the requirement for having an in-person visit with a clinician before receiving a prescription for stimulants or other Schedule II controlled substances†† (8). The combination of potential increased need and reduced barriers to access prescription stimulants might have encouraged more adults with ADHD symptoms to seek diagnosis and treatment. Although improved access to ADHD care through telehealth during the pandemic might have benefitted some persons with ADHD symptoms, it might have also introduced the potential for inadequate ADHD evaluations and inappropriate stimulant prescribing. Continued evaluation of public health emergency response policies and their use beyond the immediate emergency, such as expanded use of telehealth for prescribing, could increase understanding of long-term benefits or harms of these policies, including whether these policies increase equitable access to mental health care and the parameters needed to promote best practices (8).
The large increase in the percentage of adults receiving prescription stimulants during the COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the need for clinical practice guidelines for ADHD in adults. Well-established professional guidelines for diagnostic procedures and treatment algorithms exist for children and adolescents with ADHD (3); however, no similar diagnostic and treatment guidelines for ADHD among adults are available in the United States (9). This gap in guidance for adult ADHD care is a public health concern because of challenges associated with the differential diagnosis of ADHD (4,9) and general inadequate access to mental health providers (10) trained to diagnose and manage ADHD. Clinicians from varying specialties are approached for ADHD care, and report differing levels of training and relative comfort with diagnosing and managing ADHD (1,2,9). Stimulants are one type of treatment that can benefit persons with ADHD, but the potential harms associated with these medications, including adverse effects, interactions with other medications, and risk of diversion, misuse, and overdose (1–4) necessitate judicious prescribing and patient monitoring. Clinical guidelines similar to those developed for children and adolescents by pediatric medical associations could help clinicians provide best practice care for adult ADHD and support their patients to achieve better outcomes.
The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, the data were derived from a large convenience sample of persons with employer-sponsored insurance whose health care use patterns might differ from those of persons with other types of insurance or no insurance. Second, the data do not include the necessary demographic information to examine these trends by race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or other characteristics beyond sex and age, in which differences in equity might exist. Third, prescribing policy changes related to the pandemic varied by state (8) and might have differential effects, but state-level results are not reported here. Fourth, these results are based on insurance claims, and will not include medications or other ADHD care procured out-of-pocket or obtained through other means. Fifth, the claims data do not include information on the presence of or changes in ADHD symptoms, environmental changes that might have influenced impairment, access to diagnosis and treatment, quality of care, prescribing provider type, or if stimulants were prescribed to treat something other than ADHD; these factors might have varied throughout the study period. In addition, these data do not contain information on whether the encounter during which the prescription was made occurred via telehealth; therefore, the changes in stimulant prescribing patterns described in this study cannot be directly attributed to changes in telehealth availability and related policies. Sixth, because diagnosis codes are not included on prescription drug claims, it cannot be assumed that all prescription stimulants were prescribed to treat ADHD. However, fills for any ADHD medication, including prescription stimulants, were included as part of the case definition for ADHD care. Finally, APC is sensitive to baseline percentage; small absolute fluctuations in groups with lower baseline percentages will result in larger relative percent changes; thus, APC should be interpreted with caution when comparing across groups.
The percentage of persons receiving prescription stimulant fills increased during 2016–2021, including large increases during 2020–2021 and among adolescent and adult females and adult males. These results could guide continued monitoring of and research concerning factors contributing to increases in stimulant prescribing and other changes in care for ADHD symptoms before and during the pandemic, and how they might differ among adults and adolescent females. This study also suggests a growing need for resources to help clinicians accurately diagnose, manage, and treat adults with ADHD. The development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines for adult ADHD could be one component of an approach to facilitating the provision of high-quality care to adults with ADHD.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. firearm homicide and suicide rates increased substantially.
What is added by this report?
Weekly numbers of firearm injury emergency department (ED) visits began to increase in March 2020 even as the total number of ED visits declined, and sharply increased in late May 2020. Compared with visits during 2019, visits during 2020, 2021, and 2022 were 37%, 36%, and 20% higher, respectively.
What are the implications for public health practice?
A comprehensive approach to preventing and responding to firearm injuries is needed, including strategies that engage community and street outreach programs, implement hospital-based violence prevention programs, improve community physical environments, enhance secure storage of firearms, and strengthen social and economic supports.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. firearm homicide rate increased by nearly 35%, and the firearm suicide rate remained high during 2019–2020 (1). Provisional mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System indicate that rates continued to increase in 2021: the rates of firearm homicide and firearm suicide in 2021 were the highest recorded since 1993 and 1990, respectively (2). Firearm injuries treated in emergency departments (EDs), the primary setting for the immediate medical treatment of such injuries, gradually increased during 2018–2019 (3); however, more recent patterns of ED visits for firearm injuries, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, are unknown. Using data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP),* CDC examined changes in ED visits for initial firearm injury encounters during January 2019–December 2022, by year, patient sex, and age group. Increases in the overall weekly number of firearm injury ED visits were detected at certain periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. One such period during which there was a gradual increase was March 2020, which coincided with both the declaration of COVID-19 as a national emergency† and a pronounced decrease in the total number of ED visits. Another increase in firearm injury ED visits occurred in late May 2020, concurrent with a period marked by public outcry related to social injustice and structural racism (4), changes in state-level COVID-19–specific prevention strategies,§ decreased engagement in COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (5), and reported increases in some types of crime (4). Compared with 2019, the average number of weekly ED visits for firearm injury was 37% higher in 2020, 36% higher in 2021, and 20% higher in 2022. A comprehensive approach is needed to prevent and respond to firearm injuries in communities, including strategies that engage community and street outreach programs, implement hospital-based violence prevention programs, improve community physical environments, enhance secure storage of firearms, and strengthen social and economic supports.
CDC used near real-time electronic health record data from NSSP to examine changes in ED visits for initial firearm injury encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Temporal trends were assessed for three surveillance periods (calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022) and compared with visits from calendar year 2019. Only facilities consistently reporting more complete data¶ during 2019–2022 were included. Firearm injury ED visits were identified using a categorization including administrative diagnosis codes and free-text reason-for-visit (chief complaint terms), developed and validated by CDC in partnership with state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments** (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/125985). The mean number of weekly ED visits for firearm injuries, percent change in mean weekly ED visits for firearm injuries,†† and visit ratios (VRs)§§ with 95% CIs were examined overall, and by age group (0–14, 15–24, 25–34, 35–64, and ≥65 years) for females and males. All analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.2; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶
Coinciding with the declaration of COVID-19 as a national emergency on March 13, 2020, the weekly number of firearm injury ED visits began to increase, despite a steep decline in the total number of ED visits (Figure). The weekly number of firearm injury ED visits also sharply increased during the week of May 24, 2020, and remained high for the rest of 2020. Trends were similar among females and males.
During the study period, compared with 2019, mean weekly ED visits for firearm injury were 37% higher in 2020, 36% higher in 2021, and 20% higher in 2022, with differences by sex-specific age group (Table). Among both females and males, mean weekly ED visits for firearm injuries were consistently highest among persons aged 15–24 years across the entire study period. However, the largest increases in the proportion of firearm injury ED visits were among persons aged 0–14 years during 2020 (VRs = 2.81 for females and 2.31 for males, respectively), 2021 (VRs = 2.20 and 1.85), and 2022 (VRs = 1.49 and 1.44), compared with 2019.

Discussion
Increases in firearm injury ED visits were detected at certain periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning the week of March 13, 2020, concurrent with the declaration of COVID-19 as a national emergency,† implementation of community mitigation measures, and a decline in ED visits overall, the weekly number of firearm injury ED visits began to increase. A sharp increase in the weekly number of firearm injury ED visits occurred beginning the week of May 24, 2020, which remained elevated throughout 2020. Although this report did not assess causes for the observed increases or differentiate by intent type, the rise in visits in late May 2020 corresponded with a period of increased social unrest over strained law enforcement–community relations and longstanding systemic inequities, structural racism, and trauma experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States*** (4,6); changes in the implementation of and engagement in COVID-19 mitigation measures (5); and reported increases in some types of crime (4). Additional research is needed to better understand recent trends in firearm injuries by intent, sociodemographic characteristics, and contextual factors to help guide tailored prevention efforts and address inequities in the risk for firearm injuries (1).
The overall increases in firearm injury ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted in this study are consistent with previous research that indicated increasing national rates of firearm violence during the COVID-19 pandemic (7) and increases in the number of pediatric ED visits for firearm injuries during 2020 and 2021 compared with 2019 (8). The mean weekly number and proportion of firearm injury ED visits were higher during 2020, 2021, and 2022 compared with 2019. These patterns were observed for both sexes and across most age groups, with the youngest age group (0–14 years) experiencing the largest increase in the proportion of firearm injury ED visits. Challenges faced by children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic might have influenced their risk for firearm injury, including disruptions to daily routines and schooling (e.g., social isolation, physical distancing, and increased time spent at home, potentially increasing access to firearms in the home); changes in health care access (e.g., limited access to mental health services); and diminished security and safety (e.g., housing and financial insecurity, increased exposure to violence, threat of illness, and uncertainty about the future).††† Previous studies have also cited increases in firearm purchases and limited parental supervision as potential factors associated with heightened risk for firearm injuries among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic (9,10).
The findings in this study are subject to at least six limitations. First, NSSP ED visit data are collected using a convenience sample with geographic variations in coverage; findings are not generalizable to nonparticipating facilities and allow for limited inference regarding the underlying prevalence of firearm injuries outside EDs. However, NSSP ED visit data represent approximately 75% of U.S. EDs§§§; national trends observed in this analysis are likely representative of firearm injuries resulting in emergency care during the pandemic. Second, variations in data quality and coding practices might over- or underestimate visit trends. To address this, data were only analyzed from facilities with consistent reporting during the period of study, and the number of these EDs remained relatively constant over time. Third, the categorization used in this study captures firearm injuries overall and does not differentiate by intent. Fourth, the cross-sectional nature of this analysis, which uses electronic health record data, does not allow for causal inferences regarding changes in visit trends or contributing factors. Fifth, this study assessed changes in firearm injury ED visit counts rather than rates, which have been difficult to interpret during the COVID-19 pandemic because of changes in ED utilization that substantially affected the denominator typically used to calculate ED visit rates; still, the large number of weekly firearm injury ED visits, broad NSSP coverage, and 4-year study period allowed for a robust analysis of trends over time. Finally, some patient demographic information and facility characteristics were unavailable or incomplete at the aggregated national level. Future and ongoing collaborations with local and state health departments to refine intent-specific categorizations, improve reporting of patient and facility-level information, and assess patterns of firearm injuries by more detailed geographic characteristics (e.g., county, or rural or urban status) and with consideration of seasonality patterns might further strengthen the use of ED data for firearm injury surveillance.
A comprehensive approach is needed to prevent and respond to firearm injuries and address the social and economic inequities that contribute to the risk for violence. Near real-time ED data can equip public health practitioners, clinicians, researchers, and other partners to quickly identify trends in firearm injuries and develop tailored prevention strategies that fit the needs of their communities. Such strategies might include engaging community and street outreach programs that use trusted community members to de-escalate violent conflicts and connect those with the most need to critical support services, implementing hospital-based programs that intervene with victims of violence, improving community physical environments through vacant lot remediation and greening initiatives, enhancing secure firearm storage to reduce access to means among persons at risk for harming themselves or others, and strengthening social and economic supports for persons and families.¶¶¶

Table 1
Table 2
Nearly one in four (24.4%) U.S. adults aged 20–69 years show evidence of noise-induced hearing loss (1). Among those reporting exposure to noise outside of work, 19.9% showed possible noise-induced hearing loss. Exposure to non–job-related noise can be substantial (2). Loud music from personal listening devices and entertainment venues might place more than 1 billion teenagers and young adults at risk for hearing loss worldwide (3). Early noise exposure might increase the risk for age-related hearing loss later in life (4). CDC analyzed data from the 2022 FallStyles survey (conducted by Porter Novelli via the Ipsos’ KnowledgePanel) on U.S. adult perceptions regarding preventing hearing loss from amplified music at venues or events. More than one half of U.S. adults agreed with one or more of the following protective actions: limiting sound levels, posting warning signs, and using hearing protection when music at such events reaches potentially hazardous levels. Hearing and other health professionals can make use of existing materials available from the World Health Organization (WHO), CDC, and other professional organizations to raise awareness about noise risks and promote protective behaviors.
The 2022 FallStyles survey, conducted during September 1–24, is a nationally representative internet panel comprising 4,514 noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥18 years. The response rate was 78.1%. Results were weighted to the March 2021 supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey proportions on eight selected demographic variables: sex, age, household income, race and ethnicity, household size, highest level of educational attainment, U.S. Census Bureau region, and metropolitan residency status (living in or near an urbanized area with a population of ≥50,000). Panel members were recruited by mail, using probability-based sampling by address to reach respondents regardless of whether they had landline telephones or Internet access.* If needed, households were provided a laptop or tablet computer and Internet access. Personal identifiers were not included in the data file. Panelists who completed the survey received cash-equivalent rewards worth approximately $5.
Respondents were asked three questions about sound levels at both indoor and outdoor recreational venues and events at which enjoyment of amplified music was a central purpose of attendance. Respondents were asked how much they agreed or disagreed with each of the following statements: “Sound levels at venues or events should be limited to reduce risk of hearing loss”; “Warning signs should be posted if sound at a venue or event could exceed safe levels”; and “I would wear hearing protection if it was provided when sound at a venue or event could exceed safe levels.” Participants indicated their responses on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree). Answers were combined into three categories: 1) strongly agree or agree (agree), 2) neither agree nor disagree, and 3) disagree or strongly disagree (disagree). Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs), 95% CIs, and p-values. The following covariates were all included in the model: sex (male or female), age, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, household income, U.S. Census Bureau region of residence, and metropolitan residency status. This analysis was conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute); p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
Most respondents were female (50.9%), and 62.8% were non-Hispanic White (White) (Table 1). More than one half of respondents (54.1%) agreed that sound levels should be limited at venues or events to reduce risk of hearing loss (Figure); 75.4% agreed that warning signs should be posted if sound at a venue or event could exceed safe levels, and 61.2% agreed that they would wear hearing protection if it was provided when sound at a venue or event could exceed safe levels.
After adjusting for multiple covariates, women agreed significantly more often than did men that sound levels should be limited and that warning signs should be posted (aOR = 1.2 and 1.5, respectively) (Table 2). Respondents aged ≥63 years agreed significantly more often than did younger adults that sound levels should be limited (2.3), warning signs should be posted (1.4), and that they would wear hearing protection if provided (1.4). However, adults aged 33–47 years and 48–62 years agreed significantly less often that warning signs should be posted (0.6 and 0.7, respectively). Compared with White adults, non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) adults agreed significantly less often (0.8) with limiting sound levels. Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) adults agreed significantly more often with displaying warning signs (1.3).
Agreement with both limiting sound levels and wearing hearing protection progressively increased with the respondent’s level of educational attainment. Compared with those with less than a high school education, adults with a high school diploma, with some college or associate degree, and with a bachelor’s degree or higher agreed significantly more often with limiting sound levels (aOR = 1.5, 2.1, and 3.1, respectively) and wearing hearing protection (1.5, 1.9, and 2.8, respectively). Only adults with some college and those with at least a bachelor’s degree agreed significantly more often than did those with less education that warning signs should be posted in venues and events where sound could exceed safe levels (1.5 and 2.4, respectively).
Compared with respondents who reported an annual household income of <$25,000, those with an income of >$150,000 agreed significantly more often (aOR = 1.4) that warning signs should be posted. U.S. Census Bureau region and metropolitan residency status made little difference in perceptions regarding safe listening to amplified music at venues and events, with the exception of adults in metropolitan areas who agreed significantly that warning signs should be posted (1.5).

Discussion
The results from this survey indicate that U.S. adults are largely aware of the hazard posed by high sound levels at concerts and other events. More importantly, results indicate an encouraging openness to protective actions, such as limiting sound levels, posting warning signs, and use of hearing protection. More than one half of the respondents agreed that sound levels at venues or events should be limited to reduce risk for hearing loss, approximately three quarters of respondents agreed that warning signs should be posted if sound at a venue or event could exceed safe levels, and approximately three in five respondents agreed they would wear hearing protection if it was provided when sound at a venue or event could exceed safe levels. Survey results suggest targeting educational efforts for the use of hearing protection toward respondents aged <63 years. Raising the awareness among certain demographic groups (e.g., younger persons, Black persons, and Hispanic persons) about limiting sound levels and displaying of warning signs might be warranted.
However, stated intent to take protective action does not always result in the action being taken. In an earlier Porter Novelli Styles survey, approximately 80% of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years reported never or seldom using hearing protection at loud athletic or entertainment events. An additional 10% reported using hearing protection only some or about one half the time (5). Interventions focusing on translating intent into behavior are needed. Healthy People 2030, the nation’s public health agenda, includes an objective to increase the proportion of adults who use hearing protection devices when exposed to loud sounds (6).
In 2022, WHO published a Global Standard recommending sound levels at venues and events be limited to no more than 100 dB(A) equivalent continuous sound level§ over any 15-minute period. The limit was set to reduce “unnecessarily hazardous sound levels” while still allowing for artistic expression and enjoyment of amplified music. WHO acknowledged the limit “does not, and cannot, eliminate all risk of an individual audience member suffering sound-induced hearing injury,” particularly among those who frequently attend loud music events (7). WHO’s standard provides examples of preventive actions to reduce risk for hearing loss for audience members. These include those surveyed in this report: limiting sound levels, posting warning signs when sound could exceed safe levels, and providing hearing protection, such as earplugs, with appropriate instructions for audience members.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the data obtained in this survey were self-reported. Second, the survey relied on respondents’ perceptions of loudness and the risk for hearing loss. Third, respondents’ perceptions might be influenced by their experience of attending such events, but data on these experiences (e.g., whether or how often respondents attended events with amplified music) were not collected. Finally, although survey responses were weighted by the U.S. demographic characteristics, how accurately this weighting has corrected any bias in this internet panel sample remains unknown.
Music-induced hearing loss is entirely preventable. Hearing and other health professionals can make use of existing materials available from WHO (https://www.who.int/activities/making-listening-safe), CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/toolkit), and a variety of professional organizations (e.g., http://dangerousdecibels.org/ and https://hearinghealthfoundation.org/keeplistening) to raise awareness of noise-related risks and promote protective behaviors, such as lowering the volume, using hearing protection, and taking breaks from noisy activities. Interventions should focus on helping persons understand the risks of high sound levels and managing their exposures so they can enjoy music for a lifetime without the debilitating effects of hearing loss.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
JYNNEOS vaccine is effective in preventing monkeypox (mpox) among persons at risk.
What is added by this report?
During the current multinational outbreak, U.S. 1- and 2-dose vaccination coverage reached an estimated 37% and 23%, respectively, among persons at risk, with wide variation among jurisdictions. The predominant administration route switched from subcutaneous to intradermal after the week of August 20, 2022, in accordance with Food and Drug Administration recommendations.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Despite administration of >1 million vaccine doses, only 23% of the at-risk population has been fully vaccinated. Targeted outreach and continued access to and availability of mpox vaccines to persons at risk is important to help prevent and minimize the impact of a resurgence of mpox.

From May 2022 through the end of January 2023, approximately 30,000 cases of monkeypox (mpox) have been reported in the United States and >86,000 cases reported internationally.* JYNNEOS (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic) is recommended for subcutaneous administration to persons at increased risk for mpox (1,2) and has been demonstrated to provide protection against infection (3–5). To increase the total number of vaccine doses available, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on August 9, 2022, recommending administration of the vaccine intradermally (0.1 mL per dose) for persons aged ≥18 years who are recommended to receive it (6); intradermal administration can generate an equivalent immune response to that achieved through subcutaneous injection using approximately one fifth the subcutaneous dose (7). CDC analyzed JYNNEOS vaccine administration data submitted to CDC from jurisdictional immunization information systems (IIS)† to assess the impact of the EUA and to estimate vaccination coverage among the population at risk for mpox. During May 22, 2022–January 31, 2023, a total of 1,189,651 JYNNEOS doses (734,510 first doses and 452,884 second doses)§ were administered. Through the week of August 20, 2022, the predominant route of administration was subcutaneous, after which intradermal administration became predominant, in accordance with FDA guidance. As of January 31, 2023, 1-dose and 2-dose (full vaccination) coverage among persons at risk for mpox is estimated to have reached 36.7% and 22.7%, respectively. Despite a steady decline in mpox cases from a 7-day daily average of more than 400 cases on August 1, 2022, to five cases on January 31, 2023, vaccination for persons at risk for mpox continues to be recommended (1). Targeted outreach and continued access to and availability of mpox vaccines to persons at risk are important to help prevent and minimize the impact of a resurgence of mpox.
Since the beginning of the 2022 mpox outbreak through January 31, 2023, a total of 30,157 mpox cases and 32 associated deaths have been reported in the United States.¶ Most Monkeypox virus infections during the current outbreak have been transmitted through close, intimate contact (primarily sexual) with symptomatic persons (8). Based on the epidemiology of the current outbreak, CDC recommends mpox vaccination for persons at increased risk for mpox, including, but not limited to 1) persons with known or presumed exposure; 2) gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender, nonbinary, or gender-diverse persons with multiple recent sexual partners; 3) MSM and transgender, nonbinary, or gender-diverse persons with a newly diagnosed sexually transmitted disease; 4) persons who have had sex at or related to attending a commercial sex venue or another large social-cultural gathering during the previous 6 months; 5) those with sexual partners with any of the aforementioned risks; and 6) persons with HIV or other causes of immune suppression who have had recent or anticipate future Monkeypox virus exposure through any of these scenarios.** Preliminary studies have indicated that JYNNEOS provides protection against mpox, with unvaccinated persons having 7–14 times higher incidence than do vaccinated persons, depending on the number of doses received (3–5).
Health care providers submitted mpox vaccination data to their jurisdictions’ IIS; these data were then submitted to CDC. IIS data include information about the vaccine (e.g., manufacturer, dose, and administration route), recipient (e.g., age, sex,†† race and ethnicity, and residence), and provider (location and provider type). This analysis includes data from JYNNEOS vaccine administered to residents in the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia (DC), New York City, Philadelphia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, during May 22, 2022–January 31, 2023.
JYNNEOS vaccination coverage (the estimated proportion of the population recommended for vaccination that has been vaccinated) was calculated by jurisdiction.§§ The numerator used in calculating each jurisdiction’s coverage included data submitted to CDC on all persons aged ≥13 years with valid residence information in each jurisdiction who have been partially or fully vaccinated¶¶ with JYNNEOS. The denominator, representing the population at increased risk for Monkeypox virus exposure (8), was estimated as the number of MSM who were indicated to receive HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (among those aged ≥16 years) plus the number of MSM with HIV (among those aged ≥13 years) in each jurisdiction, using data that are publicly available via CDC AtlasPlus.*** The estimated population was then increased by 25% for each jurisdiction to account for additional persons eligible for vaccination (e.g., MSM who are at increased risk for mpox but do not have indications for PrEP, cis-female or transgender partners of MSM, close contacts [of any age] of persons with known or suspected mpox, and persons at risk for occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses)††† (Supplementary Table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126171).§§§ This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶
During May 22, 2022–January 31, 2023, 57 jurisdictions administered a total of 1,189,651 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine, 734,510 (61.7%) of which were first doses, 452,884 (38.1%) of which were second doses, and 2,257 (0.2%) of which were reported as dose 3 or higher (Table). The majority of the 734,510 persons who received ≥1 dose of vaccine were male (91.4%) and aged 25–49 years (64.2%). Among the 91% of first-dose recipients for whom race and ethnicity data were available, 51.2% were non-Hispanic White, 22.7% were Hispanic or Latino, 12.4% were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), 7.4% were non-Hispanic Asian, 5.6% were non-Hispanic multiracial, and <1% were non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. The most common vaccination locations included public health clinics (39.5%), commercial vaccination service providers (13.4%),**** medical practices (10.2%), hospitals (8.8%), and Federally Qualified Health Centers (6.2%). The highest number of both first and second doses were administered to persons living in the West U.S. Census Bureau region (261,936 and 160,457 doses, respectively); >80% of all vaccine recipients reported living in counties categorized as urban.
The distribution of administration routes differed between the first and second doses. Overall, 45.9% of first doses were administered intradermally, 50.6% were administered subcutaneously, and 3.5% were administered by other routes. Among the second doses, 85.7% were administered intradermally, 11.7% subcutaneously, and 2.6% by other routes. The change from predominantly subcutaneous to predominantly intradermal administration occurred after the week of August 20, 2022 (Figure 1).
National first and second dose JYNNEOS coverage among persons at increased risk for mpox were estimated to be 36.7% and 22.7%, respectively. Coverage estimates varied by jurisdiction, ranging from 7.4% (West Virginia) to 94.8% (DC) for first dose coverage and 4.6% (West Virginia) to 66.2% (DC) for second dose coverage. Jurisdictions estimated to have achieved ≥50% coverage for first dose (partial vaccination) were DC (94.8%), New York City (88.8%), California (61.4%), Rhode Island (58.9%), Massachusetts (53.9%), and New York (excluding New York City) (50.1%) (Figure 2).

Discussion
The national public health response strategy for mpox has resulted in administration of >1 million JYNNEOS vaccine doses. Although approximately one in eight first dose recipients were reported to be Black, this group accounts for approximately one in three mpox cases†††† (9), underscoring the importance of deploying strategies, including vaccination, that advance health equity among populations most affected by mpox. The smaller dose needed for intradermal administration increased the available vaccine supply, with each vial providing up to 5 doses compared with a single subcutaneous dose (7). The intradermal administration authorization by FDA was widely implemented within 2 weeks of issuance of the EUA in early August 2022.
Estimating vaccination coverage among persons at risk is useful for implementing and assessing public health action. Mpox vaccination coverage varied widely by jurisdiction. Three of the six jurisdictions estimated to have 1-dose coverage rates of ≥50% were also among the jurisdictions with the highest case counts (New York City, California, and New York [excluding New York City]).§§§§ Twenty-two jurisdictions are estimated to have ≤25% first-dose coverage. DC is the only jurisdiction estimated to have achieved >50% 2-dose coverage. Reasons for low or high coverage were not assessed in this analysis, but potential reasons for low coverage in some jurisdictions could include lower vaccine accessibility and awareness, fewer vaccine providers, lower vaccine confidence and demand, and concern about stigma. CDC recommends that all persons eligible for mpox vaccination get vaccinated; however, national vaccination coverage targets have not been established. Vaccine allocation and distribution were prioritized by risk for exposure to Monkeypox virus and for areas with higher case counts, making more doses available in highly affected jurisdictions during the period of peak vaccine demand.¶¶¶¶
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, coverage estimates include assumptions based on national data applied to subnational jurisdictions. For example, the increase by 25% of the vaccine-eligible population might not be appropriate for each jurisdiction. Consequently, coverage estimates for some jurisdictions might be biased. Second, residence information was self-reported and might be incomplete; in cases for which residence was not provided to the vaccination site, the site’s location might have been used. Overall, among vaccinations reported to CDC, residence data were missing for 8%. Third, some vaccination-related data elements are not available for all jurisdictions; therefore, national estimates for some characteristics might not include all jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions do not report recipients’ sex or race and ethnicity. Finally, information on sexual orientation and gender identity are not routinely collected during vaccine administration, and existing IIS systems do not include those variables; therefore, it is not possible to assess how vaccine recipients identify.
Although the number of mpox cases has decreased sharply, much is unknown about the risk for potential reintroduction of the virus and resurgence of disease in the United States. Thus, the need to improve vaccination coverage among populations at risk, increase vaccine equity, and increase the number of persons fully vaccinated (10) remain important public health goals to prevent or minimize the impact of a resurgence of mpox. Given the increased protection provided by full vaccination compared with partial vaccination (3), providing second doses to those who are partially vaccinated should also be prioritized. Continued targeted local outreach to persons at increased risk for mpox and to disproportionately affected groups and community partners to address inequities is recommended. Ongoing access to vaccine administration data from jurisdictions is important for public health decision-making and improving equitable vaccination coverage among those at risk.

Blastomycosis, caused by the fungus Blastomyces, is a rare but potentially serious infection in humans and animals. Blastomyces is endemic in Wisconsin, which reports the highest incidence of Blastomyces infection in the country, with an estimated annual statewide incidence of 2.1 cases per 100,000 residents. Some high-incidence counties report 20–40 cases per 100,000 population (1,2). Blastomyces is also found in other midwestern, south-central, and southeastern states, and lives in moist, organic soils and decaying wood and leaves. Infections typically occur when Blastomyces spores are inhaled. Blastomyces infections do not spread between humans and animals through the air. Blastomycosis usually begins with mild respiratory symptoms, which often self-resolve, but can progress to a severe, and occasionally fatal, disease without antifungal treatment. In February 2022, a veterinarian in St. Croix County, Wisconsin, alerted the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) of four dogs with diagnoses of blastomycosis, all living within a 1-mile area. Review of surveillance data identified two human cases reported in the same area within 3 weeks of the canine cases. With 1–5 human cases reported annually, St. Croix County is not considered an area with hyperendemic transmission.
In response to this cluster, Wisconsin DHS and DATCP issued alerts to physicians and veterinarians in the surrounding counties, emphasizing the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of blastomycosis. In Wisconsin, blastomycosis is reportable in humans but not in animals, and this alert encouraged local veterinarians to report cases potentially associated with this cluster. St. Croix County Public Health sent a letter to residents of the affected neighborhoods alerting them to the cluster and encouraging them to seek care if they had compatible symptoms. During January–March 2022, four persons and five dogs received a clinical diagnosis of blastomycosis. Two of the human cases received a diagnosis only after notification of the ongoing cluster. The five dogs with blastomycosis initially had mild to moderate symptoms: four experienced cough, difficulty breathing, lethargy, fever, and poor appetite. One dog had only a subcutaneous mass that contained Blastomyces yeast visible on microscopy. Urine antigen tests were positive for all infected dogs. Among the four persons with a clinical diagnosis of blastomycosis, all experienced cough, fever, and shortness of breath; symptom onset ranged from early October 2021 to early February 2022; two patients had presumptive laboratory evidence of infection, and two had confirmatory laboratory evidence.† Two patients had severe disease and required hospitalization, including one adult patient who died. Antifungal medications are used to treat blastomycosis in humans and dogs and are often required for extended periods, depending on disease severity; all five canine and four human cases were treated with antifungal medications. Before January 2022, no blastomycosis cases had been reported in residents of this neighborhood during the preceding 10 years, although one dog reportedly died of blastomycosis during the previous year.
Environmental assessments identified a river and unpaved paths running through the neighborhoods under investigation. Construction in this neighborhood during the past decade might have dispersed Blastomyces spores. A more comprehensive investigation was launched to characterize potential environmental exposure sources in this community. Analysis of these data is ongoing.
Although blastomycosis is infrequently reported, clusters have occurred primarily among persons engaging in recreational activities along waterways or in areas with ongoing excavation (3–5). Clinicians should consider blastomycosis among patients with compatible symptoms who live in or have traveled to known areas of endemicity, especially among patients with respiratory symptoms that do not resolve with antibiotic treatment. Available diagnostic tests for blastomycosis include fungal culture, cytologic smear, histopathology, identification of Blastomyces-specific nucleic acids through polymerase chain reaction or DNA probe, antigen assay, or antibody detection by immunodiffusion or enzyme immunoassay. This investigation highlights the critical contribution of a multidisciplinary One Health§ approach in public health in which an astute veterinarian recognized and reported the canine cases leading to identification of the cluster.

In 2021, 13.6% of adults aged ≥18 years assessed their health as fair or poor. The percentage increased with age from 6.9% for those aged 18–44 years, to 16.8% for those aged 45–64 years, and 22.6% for those aged ≥65 years. The same pattern of increasing percentages with age was found for adults living in families with incomes 100% to <200% of FPL and ≥200% of FPL. For adults living in families with incomes <100% of FPL, the percentage in fair or poor health was lowest among those aged 18–44 years (16.2%), but similar among adults aged 45–64 years (42.8%) and those aged ≥65 years (43.0%). The percentage of adults in fair or poor health decreased with increasing incomes for each age group.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
During the early COVID-19 pandemic (2020), U.S. incidence of reported tuberculosis (TB) substantially declined. Incidence partially rebounded in 2021 but remained lower than incidence during prepandemic years.
What is added by this report?
During 2022, reported TB incidence increased slightly. Among non–U.S.-born persons with TB, the proportion who had recently arrived in the United States increased. Higher TB incidence among American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander persons compared with other race and ethnicity groups represents an ongoing health disparity.
What are the implications for public health practice?
TB incidence is returning to prepandemic levels. TB diagnosis and treatment to interrupt transmission and prevention of TB through treatment of latent TB infection are critical to U.S. TB elimination efforts.

Table 2
Incidence of reported tuberculosis (TB) decreased gradually in the United States during 1993–2019, reaching 2.7 cases per 100,000 persons in 2019. Incidence substantially declined in 2020 to 2.2, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic (1). Proposed explanations for the decline include delayed or missed TB diagnoses, changes in migration and travel, and mortality among persons susceptible to TB reactivation (1). Disparities (e.g., by race and ethnicity) in TB incidence have been described (2). During 2021, TB incidence partially rebounded (to 2.4) but remained substantially below that during prepandemic years, raising concerns about ongoing delayed diagnoses (1). During 2022, the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC) provisionally reported 8,300 TB cases to the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System. TB incidence was calculated using midyear population estimates and stratified by birth origin and by race and ethnicity. During 2022, TB incidence increased slightly to 2.5 although it remained lower than during prepandemic years.* Compared with that in 2021, TB epidemiology in 2022 was characterized by more cases among non–U.S.-born persons newly arrived in the United States; higher TB incidence among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) persons and persons aged ≤4 and 15–24 years; and slightly lower incidence among persons aged ≥65 years. TB incidence appears to be returning to prepandemic levels. TB disparities persist; addressing these disparities requires timely TB diagnosis and treatment to interrupt transmission and prevention of TB through treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI).
Health departments in the 50 U.S. states and DC electronically report verified TB cases to CDC based on the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ surveillance case definition.† Midyear U.S. Census Bureau population estimates§ are used to calculate national, state-level, and age-stratified TB incidence. Persons with TB are grouped by self-reported race and ethnicity according to federal guidelines.¶ Persons reporting Hispanic ethnicity are categorized as Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) irrespective of race. Non-Hispanic persons are categorized by race; non-Hispanic persons who reported more than one race are categorized as “multiple race.” Midyear population estimates from the Current Population Survey** are used to calculate incidence by U.S. birth origin (U.S.-born versus non–U.S.-born)†† and by race and ethnicity. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§
During 2022, 8,300 TB cases were reported in the United States, compared with 7,874 during 2021. TB incidence during 2022 increased slightly to 2.5 per 100,000 persons, compared with 2.4 during 2021. Consistent with previous years (1), in 2022, California reported the highest number of TB cases (1,843) and Alaska reported the highest TB incidence (13.1) (Table 1).
In 2022, 73% (6,009 of 8,248 TB cases in persons for whom birth origin was known) of TB cases occurred among non–U.S.-born persons,¶¶ compared with 72% in 2021. Among U.S.-born persons, TB incidence was 0.8 during both 2021 and 2022; among non–U.S.-born persons, incidence increased slightly from 12.6 in 2021 to 12.8 in 2022 (Figure) (Table 2). Among 2,239 U.S.-born persons with TB in 2022, 673 (30%) identified as non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), 578 (26%) as Hispanic, 568 (25%) as non-Hispanic White (White), 182 (8%) as non-Hispanic Asian (Asian), 110 (5%) as AI/AN, and 52 (2%) as NH/OPI; 76 (3%) identified as multiple race or had unknown race and ethnicity. Among these groups, incidence was highest among NH/OPI persons (6.6), followed by AI/AN (4.4), Asian (2.2), and Black persons (1.9) and was lowest among White persons (0.3). Compared with that in 2021, incidence in 2022 increased 63% among Asian persons, 26% among NH/OPI persons, 16% among AI/AN persons, and 7% among Hispanic persons. Incidence declined 9% among Black persons, and 10% among White persons.***
In 2022, 6,009 TB cases occurred among non–U.S.-born persons; >80% of these cases were among Asian (2,632; 44%) or Hispanic (2,194; 37%) persons. The remaining cases occurred among Black (625; 10%), White (276; 5%), and NH/OPI (103; 2%) persons, and multiple race persons or persons whose race and ethnicity were unknown (177; 3%). In 2022, similar to that among U.S.-born persons, the highest TB incidence among non–U.S.-born persons (27.8) was among NH/OPI persons. The next highest incidence (22.0) occurred among Asian persons, followed by Black (13.7), Hispanic (10.1), AI/AN (4.3) and White (3.4) persons. Among these groups, the largest increase in incidence from 2021 to 2022 (221%) occurred among AI/AN persons, followed by NH/OPI (20%), Hispanic (13%), and White (7%) persons. Incidence declined 12% among Black persons and 7% among Asian persons in 2022.
Among non–U.S.-born persons with TB in 2022, 16.5% (992) received a diagnosis <1 year after their initial arrival in the United States, compared with 9.8% (553) during 2021. A slightly lower number and percentage of persons with newly diagnosed TB were living in the United States for >10 years in 2022 (2,821; 46.9%) compared with 2021 (2,845; 50.2%).
By age group, TB incidence in 2022 was highest among persons aged ≥65 years (3.9), followed by persons aged 45–64 (2.9), 25–44 (2.7), 15–24 (1.9), ≤4 (1.1), and 5–14 years (0.4). Compared with 2021, 2022 had the largest increase in incidence among persons aged ≤4 (28.8%) and 15–24 years (23.7%); persons aged ≥65 years were the only group that experienced a decrease (1.8%). Among 84.7% of persons with TB that had a known HIV status, 4.7% were coinfected in 2022 compared with 4.3% in 2021. Among persons with TB, increased percentages reported experiencing homelessness within 12 months preceding diagnosis (4.8%) and residing in a correctional facility (3.5%) or long-term care facility (1.7%) at the time of diagnosis in 2022, compared with 2021 (Table 2).†††

Discussion
U.S. TB incidence increased during 2022, compared with that during 2020 and 2021, but remained lower than incidence during the prepandemic years; after a substantial 20.2% decline in 2020 and partial rebound (9.8% increase) in 2021 (1), incidence appears to be returning to prepandemic levels among U.S.-born and non–U.S.-born populations.
COVID-19–associated mortality was high among persons aged ≥65 years, which might account, in part, for the lower TB incidence observed among that population (3). Even though the decrease in TB incidence was small, reduction of the population aged ≥65 years at risk for TB might have similar effects on TB incidence in future years. The increase in TB incidence among children aged ≤4 years might represent both recent transmission in the United States and infection in countries with higher TB incidence. An analysis of TB incidence among indigenous persons during 2009–2019 found a higher prevalence of underlying chronic medical conditions, and TB incidence was at least 10 times higher among AI/AN and NH/OPI persons than among White persons (2). These factors likely contributed to the higher TB incidence in these populations in this report. Among non–U.S.-born persons with TB, the higher proportion reported <1 year after arrival in the United States might reflect greater migration from higher TB incidence areas than what existed at the beginning of the pandemic.§§§
Although preventing TB transmission in the United States remains a priority, >80% of U.S. TB cases are attributed to reactivation of LTBI (1). To achieve TB elimination in the United States, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends testing and treatment among populations at higher risk for LTBI, including non–U.S.-born persons and persons in congregate living settings (4). To treat LTBI, CDC recommends short-course (3- or 4-month), rifamycin-based regimens (5). Shorter regimens are also available to treat TB: in 2022, CDC recommended a 4-month treatment regimen for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB as an alternative to the standard 6-month regimen (6). Shorter treatment durations improve treatment adherence and completion (5,6).
Higher TB incidence among AI/AN and NH/OPI persons represents an ongoing health disparity (2) in the United States. Alaska reported an increase of TB in 2022 and identified Alaska Native persons as among those at highest risk for TB (7). CDC is working to raise awareness about TB and LTBI among communities at risk for TB and their health care providers through the Think. Test. Treat TB campaign,¶¶¶ which offers resources in multiple languages for general audiences and health care providers.**** CDC also partners with community health clinics and organizations, including the TB Elimination Alliance,†††† to address TB health disparities through education and innovation.
Higher proportions of TB cases among persons experiencing homelessness or residing in correctional or long-term care facilities might be partially explained by transmission events in congregate settings. For example, gaps in TB infection control practices when resources were diverted to COVID-19 prevention and control efforts likely led to a TB outbreak in at least one state’s prison system during 2021–2022 (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, this analysis and case counts are based on provisional 2022 TB surveillance data and might change. Second, rates are calculated with population estimates that are subject to future refinement.
Knowledge of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. TB epidemiology is evolving. As COVID-19 incidence declines, TB remains an important public health challenge characterized by persistent inequities, particularly among AI/AN and NH/OPI populations, persons experiencing homelessness, and persons who are incarcerated. Timely detection and treatment of TB and LTBI among persons at risk are needed to achieve TB elimination in the United States.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis (DRTB) takes longer and is more complicated than treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The Dharavi slum in Mumbai, India has one of the highest concentrations of DRTB patients in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted TB care and treatment.
What is added by this report?
During the pandemic, many persons with DRTB in Dharavi relocated, threatening continuity of care. Patient-focused interventions facilitated successful treatment retention and improved programmatic outcomes.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Planning and implementation of simple tools helped to retain migrants on DRTB treatment during periods of COVID-19 restrictions and relocations; this approach might aid programs to serve persons on treatment for DRTB during public health emergencies, including migrant populations.

Mumbai, India’s second largest city, has one of the highest prevalences of drug-resistant tuberculosis* (DRTB) in the world. Treatment for DRTB takes longer and is more complicated than treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 300 persons receive a new DRTB diagnosis each year in Mumbai’s Dharavi slum†; historically, fewer than one half of these patients complete DRTB treatment. As nationwide restrictions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic were implemented, a program to facilitate uninterrupted DRTB care for patients receiving treatment was also implemented. A comprehensive tool and risk assessment provided support to DRTB patients and linked those who relocated outside of Dharavi during the pandemic to DRTB care at their destination. During May 2020–September 2022, a total of 973 persons received DRTB treatment in Dharavi, including 255 (26%) who relocated during treatment. Overall, 25 (3%) DRTB patients were lost to follow-up, a rate substantially lower than the rate before the pandemic (18%). Proactive planning and implementation of simple tools retained patients on treatment during periods of travel restrictions and relocations, improving programmatic outcomes. This approach might aid public health programs serving migrant populations or patients receiving treatment for DRTB during public health emergencies.
Mumbai, the capital of the state of Maharashtra, is India’s second most populous city. Within Mumbai, the Dharavi slum is the largest slum in Asia and one of the most densely populated areas in the world (1 million persons in 0.8 square miles [approximately 2.1 sq km]) and is a temporary home to persons seeking informal employment from across India.§ In 2019, Dharavi reported 265 DRTB patients, one of the highest concentrations of DRTB patients in the world; however, fewer than one half successfully finished treatment¶ (1,2). Low DRTB treatment completion is likely the consequence of the complexity of treating DRTB compared with that of treating drug-susceptible TB, including longer treatment durations, need for second-line drug regimens, more frequent drug-related adverse events, a higher prevalence of treatment relapse, and higher mortality (3).
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, a series of government-enforced nationwide travel restrictions limited local, intrastate, and interstate movement during March 23–May 31, 2020, and January 27–April 30, 2021. Because of the large number of COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, the state government extended these restrictions until June 15, 2021, during which time, movement was periodically allowed. During impending movement restrictions, many labor migrants from Dharavi, lacking a stable source of income, relocated to their permanent residences in India, traveling by foot, train, or bus (4).
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (the governing civic body of Mumbai), CDC, and Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE) India (a not-for-profit organization) implemented a public health intervention embedded within existing programmatic TB services to improve treatment outcomes and prevent treatment interruptions and migration-associated losses to follow-up. First, to establish and maintain care for DRTB patients** throughout the pandemic, a comprehensive risk assessment tool was developed that collected addresses (including permanent residence), telephone numbers of family members and close contacts, as well as potential travel routes. Destination sites and transit routes were mapped using collected information on common modes of travel. DRTB patients planning to relocate could apprise the project field coordinators of their plans during routine field encounters and make necessary preparations to continue treatment at their destination. Next, trained field coordinators, working with family members, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, community health workers, and district TB officers, used standard operating procedures to implement a series of interventions that included frequent patient contacting, active adverse events monitoring, and prompt attention to patients’ concerns to ensure continuity of care during and after relocation. For patients remaining within Dharavi, these interventions, implemented by field coordinators (who were exempted from travel restrictions), provided health services that included making telephone calls, home visits, treatment adherence counseling, and guidance for persons considering migration. For patients who had migrated, field coordinators informed the Dharavi TB program and telephoned patients and their destination TB programs to coordinate care. Visits and calls occurred every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly until treatment was completed. Routine TB services, which relied on patients coming to the TB clinic monthly and self-reporting treatment concerns and adverse events, were disrupted during the pandemic because of staff member reassignments and shortages. In response to the disruption, field coordinators visited patient homes to proactively monitor progress based on the schedule in the package of interventions (Box) and provided a 3-month supply of medications to patients for self-administration. In addition, the program connected persons to supplemental nutritional and monetary aid from governmental and nongovernmental programs. Address and travel information collected as part of the risk assessments aided in the identification of potential migrants. Migrants leaving Dharavi were provided a 1-month supply of medication to cover the potential travel period, and patients were connected with destination TB programs for continuation of care. Field coordinators counseled those who had already migrated to restart treatment in coordination with the destination TB program staff members. Participation was voluntary, and all participants had privacy and confidentiality protections. CDC provided funding and technical support; SHARE India was the implementing partner and provided the field coordinators. This intervention was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††

During May 2020–September 2022, a total of 1,007 persons registered for DRTB treatment in Dharavi, and 973 (97%) initiated treatment, including 743 patients starting new treatment, and 230 who were already on treatment. The average age of DRTB patients was 28 years (range = 4–88 years), and 541 (56%) were female. Overall, 255 (26%) persons with DRTB relocated during treatment (Table). Among those who relocated, 70 (27%) informed program staff members of a planned relocation, and the remaining 185 persons (73%) were discovered to have relocated through discussions with household members during household visits or telephone calls. Among patients who relocated, 185 (73%) returned to Dharavi by January 2023 (cyclical migrants),§§ and 70 (28%) permanently relocated (permanent migrants).¶¶ The 255 patients who relocated moved to 14 states and Union Territories in India. Migrants traveled a median of 662 miles (1,065 km) (range = 7.5–1,317 miles [12–2,120 km]). Relocation was more common during the periods of May–June 2020 and April–June 2021) (Figure).
As of January 25, 2023, among all 973 Dharavi DRTB patients, 536 (55%) were receiving DRTB treatment; 360 (37%) had completed treatment; and 52 (5%) had died (Table). Overall, 540 (55%) patients reported 2,592 separate episodes of adverse events and were referred for medical evaluation; all but 101 (4%) episodes were resolved with medications for symptoms, adjustment in TB medications, or without intervention. All DRTB patients were signed up to receive governmental monetary support and referred for nongovernmental nutritional support. Only 25 (3%) of all Dharavi DRTB patients were lost to follow-up during the program’s implementation. Among the 255 patients who migrated, 104 (41%) were receiving treatment, 123 (48%) had completed treatment successfully, 14 (6%) had died, and 14 (6%) were lost to follow-up. The proportion of patients lost to follow-up was low among both cyclical (5%) and permanent migrants (6%), suggesting that the intervention measures were effective in both populations.

Discussion
In countries such as India with high TB prevalence, clinics rely upon patients to collect their medicines monthly and self-report adverse events. By providing for the frequent contacting of patients, active monitoring of adverse events, and prompt addressing of concerns, this comprehensive package of interventions, integrated into routine programmatic care for DRTB treatment, facilitated continuity of care and improved treatment outcomes among patients from Dharavi during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nationwide, COVID-19 restrictions brought economic and logistic challenges to retaining DRTB patients in treatment. Implementation of the initial national travel restrictions in March 2020 resulted in many industries shutting down, leaving workers without wages. In anticipation of the restrictions, or after restrictions were lifted, many labor migrants traveled to and from Dharavi (4). During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation TB program was concerned that contact with persons with DRTB would be lost during migration, or that they might default on treatment, resulting in untreated DRTB and potential transmission in communities throughout India. Working across states and sectors, a network of field coordinators and District TB Officers mitigated treatment interruption, monitored for adverse events, referred patients reporting adverse events, and connected DRTB patients to additional resources when needed. For this effort, staff members and field coordinators pivoted to use of telephones, to which most patients, their family members, or their neighbor had access. Recognizing that loss of wages was an important driving factor for the migration, field coordinators linked DRTB patients to additional nutritional and monetary support provided by government and nongovernment organizations. DRTB patients planning to relocate were encouraged to inform staff members during routine field encounters; only 3% of DRTB patients were lost to follow-up during the program’s implementation, a rate substantially lower than that before the COVID-19 pandemic (18%) (2).
Ensuring continuity of TB treatment is a priority during times of public health emergencies. Studies have described successful maintenance of TB treatment services for patients during natural disasters such as floods in Kerala, India (5), during hurricanes in the United States (6,7) and Puerto Rico (8), and after an earthquake in Haiti (9). In each of these circumstances, coordination across agencies and programs, accurate contact information, and dispensation of additional medication were necessary to ensure retention of TB patients. In the case of COVID-19, the scale and length of disruption was not localized to one geographic area; local and national travel restrictions added enormous challenges for provision of TB services.
The strategy implemented in Dharavi to retain DRTB patients for treatment was successful because it focused on addressing the difficulties of DRTB treatment for the patient by actively monitoring for treatment challenges. This was a simple but effective strategy, deployed under demanding circumstances; akin to other disruptive events, expanded coordination was needed to facilitate continuity of patient care (5–9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, because many of the patient support activities occurred over the telephone, assessment of treatment adherence might have been overestimated. Second, strained health systems and staffing shortages meant that TB test results were delayed, which might have affected categorization of treatment outcomes. Thus, the proportion of patients that remained on DRTB treatment might be overestimated.
During public health emergencies, challenges to DRTB treatment completion are common, especially among persons who subsist on low wages and those without a social or financial safety net. The approach implemented in Dharavi has been adopted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in other densely populated, poor urban settings to improve DRTB treatment and care and might aid public health programs that serve migrant populations or DRTB patients during public health emergencies.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks in state prisons are uncommon. During 2014–2020, no TB cases were reported within the Washington state prison system.
What is added by this report?
During 2021–2022, a total of 25 TB cases were reported among persons incarcerated in two Washington state prisons. An additional 244 resident-contacts and staff-member–contacts without known TB histories in five facilities received a diagnosis of latent TB infection.
What are the implications for public health practice?
This is Washington’s largest TB outbreak in 20 years. Transmission was facilitated by prolonged case infectiousness and suspension of annual screenings because clinical resources were diverted to the COVID-19 pandemic response. Close collaborations between corrections departments and public health officials will be critical for ending this outbreak and preventing future TB outbreaks.

During 2014–2020, no tuberculosis (TB) cases were reported within the Washington state prison system. However, during July 2021–June 2022, 25 TB cases were reported among persons incarcerated or formerly incarcerated in two Washington state prisons. Phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequencing data indicated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all 11 patients with culture-confirmed TB were closely related, suggesting that these cases represented a single outbreak. The median infectious period for 12 patients who were considered likely contagious was 170 days. As of November 15, 2022, the Washington State Department of Corrections (WADOC) and Washington State Department of Health (WADOH), with technical assistance from CDC, had identified 3,075 contacts among incarcerated residents and staff members at five state prisons, and 244 contacts without a known TB history received a diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI). Persons who were evaluated for TB disease were isolated; those receiving a diagnosis of TB then initiated antituberculosis therapy. Persons with LTBI were offered treatment to prevent progression to TB disease. This ongoing TB outbreak is the largest in Washington in 20 years. Suspension of annual TB screening while limited resources were redirected toward the COVID-19 response resulted in delayed case detection that facilitated TB transmission. In addition, fear of isolation might discourage residents and staff members from reporting symptoms, which likely also leads to delayed TB diagnoses. Continued close collaboration between WADOC and WADOH is needed to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks.

Investigation and Results
During July–August 2021, one incarcerated person with TB disease and two others with LTBI were identified in a single Washington state prison (facility A). A subsequent source investigation conducted by WADOC in collaboration with WADOH identified one additional person at facility A with TB disease and 27 persons with LTBI. None of the persons who received a diagnosis during July–August 2021 experienced clinical characteristics associated with infectiousness (e.g., sputum smear positivity). This finding led to concern by WADOH and WADOC that these cases might represent transmission associated with a person with undiagnosed infectious TB disease elsewhere within the prison system or who was recently released from prison. During December 2021–January 2022, three persons incarcerated at another Washington state prison (facility B) received a diagnosis of TB disease, including a person who had been released into the community and another who had been transferred to a third facility (facility C). WADOC and WADOH requested CDC assistance to facilitate ongoing outbreak investigation efforts; CDC deployed a team to Washington on February 7, 2022. Outbreak cases, defined as clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB disease in persons who were incarcerated or had worked in WADOC since September 2019, were identified through facility-based testing and medical evaluations. Clinical chart reviews and provider interviews were used to characterize cases and estimate infectious periods according to CDC guidelines (1). Because of staff member and resident movement among prison facilities as well as releases into the community, the ongoing investigation has thus far included all 12 WADOC prisons and most of Washington’s local health jurisdictions. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*
As of November 15, 2022, a total of 25 cases† of TB disease among incarcerated persons had been reported to WADOH and were connected to the outbreak; the most recent case was reported on June 23, 2022 (Figure). No cases of TB disease were identified among prison staff members. Nineteen persons received a diagnosis of pulmonary TB disease with or without extrapulmonary TB. All 25 patients received a chest radiograph or computed tomography scan, and their sputum specimens were tested; none had cavitary findings on imaging, and four had a positive acid-fast bacilli smear. Isolates from all 11 culture-confirmed cases were closely related by whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, consistent with epidemiologic data suggesting recent transmission. Contact investigations were initiated at five facilities for 12 persons with TB disease who were considered likely to be contagious: the 11 persons with positive cultures and one additional person with a negative culture but with symptomatic pulmonary disease and clinically important chest radiograph findings. The median estimated infectious period for these 12 patients was 170 days (range = 91–391 days). The person with the longest infectious period was likely the first to develop infectious TB (i.e., estimated infectious period start date was January 1, 2021) and resided in facilities A and B during the infectious period. During the initial source investigation in August 2021, this person received a negative tuberculin skin test (TST) result and did not disclose symptoms, despite chart notes indicating a chronic cough and weight loss that began around July 2021. The person had a history of untreated LTBI, but this was not noted at the time. Therefore, a chest radiograph was not performed until a subsequent TB screening was conducted at facility B in January 2022; the radiograph findings were then reported to be abnormal.
A contact of a patient with TB was defined as an incarcerated person or staff member who had been in the same location on the same day as the patient during the patient’s estimated infectious period. As of November 15, 2022, a total of 2,644 residents in five facilities and 431 staff members in four facilities were identified as contacts. Among 2,093 (79.2%) resident-contacts and 135 (31.3%) staff-member–contacts who had no evidence of previous TB infection or disease and were tested within a WADOC facility since January 1, 2021, 237 (11.3%), and seven (5.2%), respectively, received positive TB test results.
Top
Public Health Response
After confirming the initial cases identified at facility A (in July 2021) and facility B (in December 2021), WADOC, in collaboration with WADOH, initiated TB screenings of incarcerated persons and staff members within facilities A, B, and C. Beginning in February 2022, CDC’s technical assistance team provided additional support for contact investigations by incorporating WADOC data on overnight locations and daily movements, staff member schedules, and clinical risk factors. Most persons born in the United States received testing using TSTs, and most persons not born in the United States received testing using interferon-gamma release assays. Following CDC guidelines for TB exposure, a TST result with ≥5 mm of induration in a specimen from a contact was considered positive (1). Persons with newly identified TB infection and persons with a previous positive TB test result or TB symptoms (irrespective of test result) were referred for chest radiography and clinical evaluation for TB disease. Persons who were being evaluated for TB disease were isolated and, if they received a TB diagnosis, initiated 4–6 months of antituberculosis therapy. For persons with LTBI, a 3-month isoniazid and rifapentine therapy was the preferred regimen. However, because of nationwide shortages of rifamycins, treatment was delayed for some persons; those persons who were considerably immunosuppressed from a medical condition or medication use were offered a 9-month isoniazid regimen to prevent delays in treatment because of their increased risk for progression to TB disease. Informational sessions on TB prevention and treatment were held for residents, their families, and facility personnel.

Discussion
This is the first recorded TB outbreak in WADOC and the largest TB outbreak in Washington in 20 years. Multiple factors complicated case diagnosis and likely contributed to outbreak-associated transmission. First, annual TB testing of residents had been suspended at WADOC facilities, in some instances for up to 2 years, as WADOC redirected resources toward COVID-19 prevention and control. Although TB outbreaks in state prison systems before the COVID-19 pandemic had become uncommon (2), and WADOC had had no TB cases for approximately 5 years, these findings suggest that interruptions in routine TB prevention measures can facilitate M. tuberculosis transmission within correctional settings. Second, diagnostic delays contributed to outbreak-associated transmission because patients were contagious for longer periods; on-site and community clinicians did not promptly diagnose TB in two patients who were later found to have pulmonary TB disease, despite their having compatible symptoms. One of these patients was the person who had been transferred from facility A to facility B while contagious. Delayed detection of TB cases in low-incidence settings is a frequent contributor to outbreaks in the United States (3,4). The relative rarity of TB disease before the outbreak, the overlap of common TB symptoms with those of COVID-19, and a coincident COVID-19 outbreak within the prison system might have also contributed (5). In addition, fear of physical and social isolation among residents and potential social isolation and loss of work hours for staff members were likely disincentives to reporting symptoms or consenting to TB testing once screenings were initiated for many persons.
Outbreak response requires prompt diagnosis of TB disease, isolation of contagious persons, treatment of disease to cure, and prevention of disease through treating LTBI (6–8). During the outbreak response, nationwide shortages of rifamycins (9), cornerstones of preferred LTBI treatment regimens, led to delays in treatment initiation for some persons. During these shortages, alternative isoniazid monotherapy LTBI treatment regimens were prescribed only for persons at high risk for TB progression, because these regimens are longer in duration and are associated with increased risk for liver toxicity (8,10). Within WADOC, fully reinstating routine screening for TB symptoms and testing for LTBI and TB disease, raising TB awareness among incarcerated persons, staff members, and medical personnel, and implementing policies to reinforce symptom reporting and TB testing could facilitate earlier detection and intervention. In addition, establishing and maintaining efficient data management systems is important for managing contact investigations of this scale, actions for which state prisons are not always equipped or funded. Therefore, ongoing strong collaborations between correctional systems and health departments are needed to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Directly observed therapy (DOT) for tuberculosis treatment involves observing a patient ingest medication, monitoring the patient for adverse events, and providing support for treatment completion. DOT has typically been conducted in person; however, scheduling in-person DOT can present logistical challenges.
What is added by this report?
Based on published evidence evaluating treatment adherence and completion and microbiologic resolution of disease, CDC recommends video DOT (vDOT) as equivalent to in-person DOT for persons undergoing treatment for diagnosed tuberculosis.
What are the implications for public health practice?
vDOT can assist health department tuberculosis programs meet the U.S. standard of care for patients undergoing tuberculosis treatment, while using resources efficiently.

U.S. clinical practice guidelines recommend directly observed therapy (DOT) as the standard of care for tuberculosis (TB) treatment (1). DOT, during which a health care worker observes a patient ingesting the TB medications, has typically been conducted in person. Video DOT (vDOT) uses video-enabled devices to facilitate remote interactions between patients and health care workers to promote medication adherence and clinical monitoring. Published systematic reviews, a published meta-analysis, and a literature search through 2022 demonstrate that vDOT is associated with a higher proportion of medication doses being observed and similar proportions of cases with treatment completion and microbiologic resolution when compared with in-person DOT (2–5). Based on this evidence, CDC has updated the recommendation for DOT during TB treatment to include vDOT as an equivalent alternative to in-person DOT. vDOT can assist health department TB programs meet the U.S. standard of care for patients undergoing TB treatment, while using resources efficiently.
Top
Background
The 2016 U.S. clinical practice guidelines for TB treatment recommend DOT as the standard of care (1). During DOT, a health care worker observes patients ingest their medications, monitors them for adverse events, and provides social support (e.g., personal connection, encouragement, advice, or assistance navigating challenges that occur with illness). Typically, DOT has involved meeting in person at a mutually agreed-upon location within the community or in a clinical setting; however, participation in DOT in person can be logistically challenging. Scheduling can interfere with patients’ employment, schooling, or other daily activities, and arranging transportation for DOT can be difficult. With community-based DOT, the daily arrival and departure of health care workers might also prompt unwelcome questions from neighbors or coworkers or result in the creation of stigma for the patient. Moreover, in-person DOT might not always be feasible during inclement weather, natural disasters, or a pandemic.
vDOT (also known as video DOT) allows persons undergoing TB treatment the opportunity to use video-enabled phones, tablets, or computers to remotely interact with health care workers in real time (synchronous) or through recorded videos (asynchronous). CDC reviewed published evidence on vDOT compared with in-person DOT for TB treatment adherence, completion, and microbiologic resolution to update the 2016 clinical practice guidelines (1). This update is for organizations and providers responsible for providing care for and monitoring treatment of persons with diagnosed TB in the United States and affiliated areas. Additional considerations, concerns, and limitations are available.*
Top
Methods
CDC developed these guidelines based on evidence presented by a systematic review and a meta-analysis that included studies published from the time the searched databases were initially available through January 2021 (2). An additional search of articles published during February 1, 2021–May 13, 2022, was conducted to identify subsequent studies that were not included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The search of articles listed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases was conducted using the keywords “tuberculosis” and “directly observed therapy”; “directly observed treatment”; “video observed”; “video supported”; “adherence”; “treatment completion”; or “cell-,” “smart-,” or “tele-” “phone.” Studies were excluded if they did not report data for treatment adherence, treatment completion, or microbiologic testing; did not have a comparison group; or focused on the use of text message reminders or device-facilitated monitoring without video capability (e.g., medication containers with wireless sensors or ingestible sensors). Studies were also excluded if they compared vDOT with self-administered therapy or reported populations undergoing TB treatment in an inpatient, institutional, or medically supervised residential setting (e.g., a rehabilitation center). Two reviewers screened article abstracts for exclusion criteria and then independently documented participant demographics, DOT methods, doses scheduled for DOT, medication adherence, and treatment outcomes from retained articles that met inclusion criteria. Studies involving persons of any age, any sex, and from any upper-middle– to high-income country with a diagnosis (or suspected diagnosis) of TB, including pulmonary disease, extrapulmonary disease, and drug-resistant TB, undergoing treatment in an outpatient setting were included (6). The Methods Manual for Community Guide Systematic Reviews provided a framework for data collection from retained articles (7). Consistent with the evidence quality tools used in the published meta-analysis, retained articles were reviewed with the Revised Tool for Assessing Risk of Bias in Randomized Trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Standards (2,6–9). During May–September 2022, CDC reviewed the evidence and drafted recommendations. These recommendations were reviewed favorably by external TB subject matter experts and were presented for public comment during the December 2022 Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis† meeting. Comments supported the updated recommendations without further modifications.
Top
Rationale and Evidence
Literature Review. Two systematic reviews that assessed technology interventions for TB treatment were identified (2,3). The first review combined vDOT, text reminders, and medication monitoring boxes for comparison with in-person DOT (3); because of the combination of interventions assessed, this review was excluded. The second review, a meta-analysis comparing vDOT with in-person DOT, assessed treatment adherence, treatment completion, and microbiologic resolution (2). This published meta-analysis was used as supporting evidence and as the starting point for an updated literature search. The updated literature search yielded five articles published after the meta-analysis, two of which were retained as supporting evidence (4,5). Three articles were excluded for the following reasons: two did not include a comparison group (10,11), and one reported previously published data (12) included in the meta-analysis (2).
Top
Evidence Summary
Treatment Adherence. The meta-analysis (2), one randomized controlled trial (RCT) (4), and one prospective observational study (5) examined the proportion of medication doses observed by TB program staff members (Table). The meta-analysis defined treatment adherence as observation of ≥80% of prescribed doses. The RCT and observational study defined adherence as the observed proportion of total prescribed doses. The meta-analysis and observational study found higher adherence among patients on vDOT than among those receiving in-person DOT (78.8% versus 27.2%, and 68.4% versus 53.9%, respectively). The observational study focused on doses taken Monday through Friday (5). Per program practice, if a patient using vDOT missed a weekday dose and submitted additional videos on the weekend, these doses were included in the weekly adherence count. The RCT found that vDOT was as effective as in-person DOT at achieving observed doses (89.8% versus 87.2%) (4).
Treatment Completion. The meta-analysis (2) defined completion of treatment as not prematurely stopping treatment or being lost to follow-up. The observational study (5) defined completion based on a set number of target doses (Table). Treatment completion was similar among patients receiving vDOT and in-person DOT (79.0% versus 68.2%, respectively, in the meta-analysis, and 96% versus 90%, respectively, in the observational study). The RCT did not evaluate treatment completion (4).
Microbiologic Resolution. The meta-analysis (2) and observational study (5) reported results for microbiologic resolution, the principal prognostic indicator for TB treatment response. The RCT did not evaluate microbiologic outcomes (4). Meta-analysis results were based on radiography and negative sputum smear test results by the last month of treatment and on at least one previous occasion. The observational study reported microbiologic resolution as the mean number of days to culture conversion (i.e., time between treatment start date and date of first negative culture result, after which no further positive culture results were obtained). Microbiologic resolution was similar between patients receiving vDOT and in-person DOT (93.0% versus 87.8%, respectively, in the meta-analysis, and a mean of 48 days versus 47 days, respectively, to culture conversion in the observational study).
Top
Updated Recommendation
Missed doses of medication or treatment interruptions can lead to suboptimal drug concentrations, acquired drug resistance, longer treatment times, TB treatment failure, and recurrence of TB disease. For these reasons, CDC continues to recommend DOT as the standard of care for all persons prescribed TB treatment; however, based on the evidence summary, this report updates the 2016 CDC U.S. clinical practice guidelines (1) to state that vDOT should be considered equivalent to in-person DOT.
Top
Considerations
Decisions regarding the use of vDOT or in-person DOT during TB treatment are best made when health care providers and patients work in partnership to discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of both DOT approaches. Topics to address in shared decision-making discussions include the patient’s health care needs, social conditions, preferences, regular access to video-enabled devices and the Internet, insurance reimbursement (as applicable), confidentiality and privacy, as well as program capacities and provider preferences. For patients receiving injectable medications, experiencing circumstances that they and their providers decide would benefit from additional monitoring, or who are unable to use vDOT technology, in-person DOT is likely the better treatment option.
Top
Discussion
This update of CDC recommendations is based on evidence that vDOT is associated with a higher proportion of medication doses being observed and similar rates of TB treatment completion and microbiologic resolution when compared with in-person DOT. These data, combined with research that has demonstrated vDOT can conserve time and costs for patients and programs (13,14), improve patient satisfaction with DOT (14), and provide opportunities to monitor adherence when in-person DOT is not feasible (5), highlight the utility of vDOT to sustain patient care and treatment.
To date, few RCTs and cohort studies of vDOT have been conducted. Studies have been heterogenous with respect to video type (synchronous versus asynchronous) and location of in-person DOT (clinic versus community). In addition, published studies have been conducted in urban and suburban settings, with adults, and in locations with broad Internet availability. Thus, additional evaluation of vDOT implementation in more diverse settings and with diverse populations will address evidence gaps and expand the current knowledge base. Moreover, technology has evolved rapidly during the past decade, and this evolution will likely continue, adding to the evidence and further guiding best practices for the use of vDOT to support patients in their treatment adherence. CDC will continue to monitor relevant reports and update this guidance as necessary.

Introduction: In 2004, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), with CDC as a major U.S. government implementing agency, began providing HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) worldwide. Through suppression of HIV viral load, effective ART reduces morbidity and mortality among persons with HIV infection and prevents vertical and sexual transmission.
Methods: To describe program impact, data were analyzed from all PEPFAR programs and from six countries that have conducted nationally representative Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) surveys, including PEPFAR programmatic data on the number of persons with HIV infection receiving PEPFAR-supported ART (2004–2022), rates of viral load coverage (the proportion of eligible persons with HIV infection who received a viral load test) and viral load suppression (proportion of persons who received a viral load test with <1,000 HIV copies per mL of blood) (2015–2022), and population viral load suppression rates in six countries that had two PHIA surveys conducted during 2015–2021. To assess health system strengthening, data on workforce and laboratory systems were analyzed.
Results: By September 2022, approximately 20 million persons with HIV infection in 54 countries were receiving PEPFAR-supported ART (62% CDC-supported); this number increased 300-fold from the 66,550 reported in September 2004. During 2015–2022, viral load coverage more than tripled, from 24% to 80%, and viral load suppression increased from 80% to 95%. Despite increases in viral load suppression rates and health system strengthening investments, variability exists in viral load coverage among some subpopulations (children aged <10 years, males, pregnant women, men who have sex with men [MSM], persons in prisons and other closed settings [persons in prisons], and transgender persons) and in viral load suppression among other subpopulations (pregnant and breastfeeding women, persons in prisons, and persons aged <20 years).
Conclusions and implications for public health practice: Since 2004, PEPFAR has scaled up effective ART to approximately 20 million persons with HIV infection in 54 countries. To eliminate HIV as a global public health threat, achievements must be sustained and expanded to reach all subpopulations. CDC and PEPFAR remain committed to tackling HIV while strengthening public health systems and global health security.

Introduction
The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was announced in January 2003 and remains the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease. PEPFAR’s core aim is to address health inequities in access to HIV services. The initial goal was to prevent 7 million infections, treat 2 million persons, and provide humane care for persons suffering from AIDS and for children orphaned by AIDS.† At the time, approximately 30 million persons with HIV infection were estimated to live on the African continent, including 3 million children and adolescents aged <15 years; however, only 50,000 were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).§ Since 2004, PEPFAR has supported partner governments’ expansion of ART delivery while strengthening health systems. Through viral load suppression, effective ART reduces morbidity and mortality among persons with HIV infection (1); it also prevents vertical transmission from mothers with HIV infection to their infants if the mother is on ART and the HIV-exposed infant receives prophylaxis; and prevents sexual transmission when viral load is undetectable (<200 copies per mL of blood) (2–5).
PEPFAR, led and coordinated by the U.S. Department of State, uses a whole-of-government approach for global HIV/AIDS response, implemented by seven U.S. government departments and agencies, including CDC.¶ As the U.S. agency responsible for protecting public health, CDC couples its core area investments in public health workforce development, surveillance, and laboratory capacity with scientific and technical expertise and data-driven approaches to fight the global HIV epidemic and other threats to global health security.**
PEPFAR supports the Sustainable Development Goals and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS’ (UNAIDS) fast-track strategy to end the AIDS epidemic as a global threat by 2030: that 95% of persons with HIV infection know their status, that 95% of those with known status receive ART, and that 95% of those receiving ART achieve viral load suppression.†† Worldwide in 2021, an estimated 38.4 million persons had HIV infection; 650,000 AIDS-related deaths and 1.5 million new infections occurred.§§ An estimated 28.7 million persons with HIV infection were receiving ART, and among those receiving ART, an estimated 92% had suppressed viral loads. To assess PEPFAR-supported program impact and health system–strengthening investments, programmatic data from all PEPFAR programs and survey data for six countries with more than one Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) survey were analyzed.¶¶
Top
Methods
To describe program impact, PEPFAR Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting*** programmatic data were analyzed by age, sex, and subpopulation (pregnant or breastfeeding women and key populations, including female sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender persons, persons who inject drugs, and persons in prisons), and proportion of CDC contribution; analyses were stratified by fiscal year (October–September).††† Before October 2018, persons with HIV infection receiving PEPFAR-supported ART were defined as persons currently receiving ART and for whom ≤90 days had elapsed after missing a scheduled ART pickup; in October 2018, this definition changed to persons currently receiving ART for whom ≤28 days had elapsed after missing a scheduled ART pickup. A proxy rate for viral load coverage was calculated as the percentage of persons with HIV infection receiving ART for ≥6 months with documented receipt of a viral load test within the previous 12 months. As an indicator of ART effectiveness, viral load suppression was defined as <1,000 HIV copies per mL of blood, and the viral load suppression rate was calculated as the number of persons with HIV infection with viral load suppression among those who received a viral load test. Using data from the PEPFAR-supported, CDC-led PHIA surveys, population viral load suppression rates by sex and age group (15–24, 25–34, 35–49, and ≥50 years) were analyzed for six countries (Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) that completed two surveys during 2015–2021.§§§
PEPFAR Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting data were analyzed to describe health system strengthening investments. The workforce includes the number of health care workers (including lay, clinical, pharmacy, and laboratory workers) who provide HIV- or tuberculosis (TB)-related prevention, treatment, or other HIV-related services in community, clinic, or other settings. Molecular testing capacity was defined as the existence of a facility with dedicated infrastructure and staff members trained to conduct HIV early infant diagnosis, viral load, or TB molecular diagnostic testing. Laboratory continuous quality improvement enrollment was defined as participation in activities aimed at ensuring diagnostic accuracy and reliability supported by a recognized laboratory continuous quality improvement program. Accreditation was defined as achieving the highest standard of clinical laboratory quality as assessed by a nationally, regionally, or internationally recognized accrediting body. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶

Results
During 2004–2022, the number of persons with HIV infection receiving PEPFAR-supported ART increased 300-fold, from 66,550 to 20,166,110, in 54 countries (Figure 1). During 2015–2022, the annual number of persons with HIV infection who received a viral load test increased 605%, from 2,109,749 to 14,875,130, and the overall viral load coverage rate increased 233%, from 24% (2,109,749 of 8,806,300 eligible persons who received a viral load test) to 80% (14,875,130 of 18,573,406) (Figure 2) (Table 1). During 2017–2022, viral load coverage rates increased to approximately 75% among women, men, and persons aged <10, 10–19, and ≥20 years; among pregnant women, viral load coverage increased 72%, from 18% to 31%. During 2020–2022, viral load coverage increased from 70% to 85% among female sex workers, from 62% to 83% among persons who inject drugs, and from 64% to 78% among MSM. Among transgender persons, viral load coverage decreased 6%, from 71% to 67%, and among persons in prisons, coverage decreased 24%, from 75% to 57%.
During 2015–2022, the viral load suppression rate among those receiving testing increased from 80% (1,691,232 persons with viral load suppression of 2,109,749 who received a viral load test) to 95% (14,146,647 of 14,875,130) (Figure 2). During 2017–2022, the viral load suppression rate increased among women, men, persons aged <10, 10–19, and ≥20 years, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women. Males, females, and those aged ≥20 years reached viral load suppression rates of ≥95% in 2022 (Table 1). By 2022, the viral load suppression rate among female sex workers, MSM, transgender persons, and persons who inject drugs reached ≥95%, but among persons in prisons, remained unchanged, at 93%.
PHIA survey results demonstrated increased population viral load suppression rates in all six assessed countries, with overall viral load suppression rates in the first and second surveys ranging from 59.2% (Zambia) to 73.1% (Eswatini) and 75.4% (Uganda) to 88.6% (Eswatini), respectively (Table 2). Across all surveys, with few exceptions, population viral load suppression rates were higher in older than in younger persons, and higher in women than in men.
In 2022, the PEPFAR-supported workforce included 371,760 health care workers in approximately 70,000 community, clinic, or other settings. During 2017–2022, the number of PEPFAR-supported facilities with a molecular laboratory increased by 115%, from 926 to 1,995; the number of PEPFAR-supported facilities with one or more laboratory enrolled in a continuous quality improvement program increased by 112%, from 795 to 1,687; and those that were accredited increased by 194%, from 103 to 303.
In 2010, approximately one half of persons with HIV infection receiving PEPFAR-supported ART received services through CDC implementing partners (Figure 1). By September 2022, CDC implementing partners supported 62% (12,566,736 of 20,166,110 persons with HIV infection receiving PEPFAR-supported ART) of the PEPFAR total. Among the total PEPFAR-supported workforce in 2022, 42% were supported through CDC implementing partners.

Discussion
The cumulative program impact of PEPFAR among 54 countries reached approximately 20.2 million persons with HIV infection with lifesaving ART by September 2022, a 300-fold increase from 2004. PEPFAR-supported ART is effective, as demonstrated by program data indicating that the UNAIDS target for viral load suppression was achieved in 2022, and by PHIA survey data indicating increased viral load suppression rates at the population level (i.e., not restricted to persons with HIV infection receiving PEPFAR-supported ART). By providing effective ART, PEPFAR’s investments have helped avert new HIV infections (6) and have led to sustained declines in all-cause mortality.**** For example, in Uganda, the first PEPFAR-supported country, ART scale-up since 2004 has helped to avert an estimated 500,000 infections, including approximately 230,000 infections among HIV-exposed infants, and 600,000 HIV-related deaths (7). In Eswatini, national HIV incidence decreased by nearly one half and viral load suppression doubled during 2011–2016 (8).
PEPFAR program impact is founded on strengthened health systems. Improvements in laboratory capacity, including molecular testing and continuous quality improvement activities described in this report, have supported the full HIV cascade of care (9), including accurate HIV diagnosis, treatment, and viral load monitoring of ART effectiveness. Investments reflect PEPFAR’s commitment to local public health system strengthening for broader pandemic preparedness and response. Under PEPFAR’s current 5-year strategy,†††† the United States aims to eliminate the HIV/AIDS pandemic as a public health threat by 2030, while sustainably strengthening public health systems.
Through PEPFAR, CDC is at the forefront of global ART scale-up efforts. CDC receives approximately 50% of PEPFAR funding for HIV treatment and supports approximately 60% of all persons receiving ART through PEPFAR. The PEPFAR-supported CDC-led PHIA surveys have provided rigorous estimates of critical HIV indicators by age group, sex, and subnational geographic units. Other PEPFAR investments achieved through CDC have strengthened surveillance systems, such as health and laboratory information systems for patient and program monitoring, as well as HIV case reporting. The PEPFAR laboratory continuous quality improvement program (Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation§§§§) has provided practical tools for resource-limited settings to improve quality management systems and prepare laboratories for accreditation¶¶¶¶ (10). CDC provides leadership in the use of multiple data sources to continually identify gaps in HIV service delivery for policy and program action (11,12).
Beyond HIV, PEPFAR investments in public health system strengthening have had additional benefits, including improving global health security. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, PEPFAR-supported countries demonstrated the resilience of PEPFAR investments by protecting and advancing HIV response gains (13,14), while also responding to COVID-19. In Nigeria, an ART surge in nine states supported by CDC through PEPFAR rapidly increased the total number of persons with HIV infection receiving ART by 26% (110,815) during April–September 2020 alone (15,16). PEPFAR investments have been leveraged for public health emergency response. Workforce investments have trained and deployed large numbers of health care workers not only to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV and provide quality care for persons with HIV infection, but also to identify, track, and contain other health threats such as cholera, Ebola virus disease, and COVID-19.***** During April 2020–March 2021, a total of 109 PEPFAR-supported centralized HIV viral load and early infant diagnosis laboratories and 138 decentralized HIV and TB sites reported conducting approximately 3.4 million SARS-CoV-2 tests in 16 countries (17).
Despite these achievements, 10 million persons with HIV infection worldwide (in countries with and without PEPFAR support) were not receiving ART in 2021, and gaps exist among certain subpopulations. Global HIV control cannot be achieved without prioritizing health equity. For example, although overall viral load coverage rates have increased over time, rates were lower among children aged <10 years, males, pregnant women, MSM, persons in prisons, and transgender persons. Similarly, whereas overall viral load suppression rates reached the UNAIDS target of 95% of persons with HIV infection receiving ART, rates were lower among pregnant and breastfeeding women and persons in prisons, and much lower for persons aged <20 years, including children and adolescents with HIV infection. Results from PHIA surveys further highlight lower viral load suppression rates among younger age groups and among men compared with women. Stigma and discrimination remain important barriers to health equity. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender women is significantly higher than it is in the general population (18). Understanding the root causes including structural determinants of health for the observed differences and addressing potential factors leading to health disparities is essential to eliminate HIV as a global public health threat.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, indicator definitions and the systems to collect and report data have evolved over time, which might have affected data quality and results observed. Second, the countries, number of sites reporting, changes in national HIV guidelines (i.e., prevention, treatment, ART initiation criteria, recommended ART regimens, and monitoring), and the ability for persons with HIV infection to access services at any site have also evolved, which might have affected results observed. Third, misclassification of patients in certain subpopulations might have occurred if this information was not disclosed and captured by medical records. Fourth, viral load coverage analyses used aggregate program data, and as such, reported viral load proxy coverage rates could differ from actual viral load coverage rates. Fifth, because some facilities might have more than one laboratory, the number of laboratories might have been underreported. Finally, programmatic data cannot be directly compared with PHIA results, which are derived through representative sampling methods.
Since 2004, PEPFAR has scaled up ART to approximately 20 million persons with HIV infection worldwide, managing a chronic disease at an unprecedented level while strengthening public health systems through workforce, surveillance, and laboratory capacity investments. To eliminate HIV as a global public health threat, achievements in HIV services must be sustained and expanded to reach all subpopulations. PEPFAR remains committed to supporting partner governments to eliminate HIV as a global public health threat while strengthening public health systems and global health security.

Abbreviation: FPL = federal poverty level.
* Age-adjusted percentages are based on the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau standard population, using age groups 18–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, and ≥75 years, with 95% CIs indicated by error bars.
† Serious psychological distress is based on responses to six questions, “During the past 30 days, how often did you feel 1) so sad that nothing could cheer you up, 2) nervous, 3) restless or fidgety, 4) hopeless, 5) that everything was an effort, or 6) worthless?” The response options “none of the time,” “a little of the time,” “some of the time,” “most of the time,” and “all of the time” were each scored from 0–4 points, respectively, and then summed for a total score ranging from 0–24 points. A value of ≥13 was used to define serious psychological distress. Only respondents who answered all six questions were included in the analysis.
§ Family income groups were defined based on family income as a percentage of the federal poverty threshold. Poverty thresholds, which are published by the U.S. Census Bureau, vary by family size and the number of children in the family. Family income was imputed when missing using multiple imputation methodology.
¶ Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Babesiosis is an emerging zoonotic tickborne parasitic disease in the United States and occurs primarily in the Northeast and Midwest.
What is added by this report?
During 2011–2019, U.S. babesiosis incidence significantly increased in northeastern states. Three states (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) that were not considered to have endemic babesiosis had significantly increasing incidences and reported case counts similar to or higher than those in the seven states with known endemic transmission.
What are the implications for public health practice?
As case rates rise in multiple states, tick prevention messaging, provider education, and traveler risk awareness should be emphasized.

Babesiosis is a tickborne disease caused by intraerythrocytic Babesia parasites. In the United States, most babesiosis cases are caused by Babesia microti, transmitted from bites of blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, in northeastern and midwestern states. Transmission can also occur through blood transfusions, transplantation of organs from infected donors, or congenital (mother-to-child) transmission (1). Babesia infection can be asymptomatic or cause mild to severe illness that can be fatal. Overall, U.S. tickborne disease cases have increased 25%, from 40,795 reported in 2011 to 50,856 in 2019 (2). Babesiosis trends were assessed in 10 states* where babesiosis was reportable during 2011–2019. Incidence increased significantly in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont (p<0.001), with the largest increases reported in Vermont (1,602%, from two to 34 cases), Maine (1,422%, from nine to 138), New Hampshire (372%, from 13 to 78), and Connecticut (338%, from 74 to 328). Unlike the other seven states, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, were not included as states with endemic disease in previous CDC babesiosis surveillance summaries. These three states should now be considered to have endemic transmission comparable to that in other high-incidence states; they have consistently identified newly acquired cases every year during 2011–2019 and documented presence of Babesia microti in the associated tick vector (3). Because incidence in Northeastern states, including Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, is increasing, tick prevention messaging, provider education, and awareness of infection risk among travelers to these states should be emphasized.
Babesiosis can cause illness ranging from asymptomatic or mild to severe; the disease can be fatal, particularly among persons who are immunocompromised or asplenic. Common symptoms include fever, muscle and joint pain, and headache. In certain patients, severe complications can occur, including thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (1). Babesiosis can be treated using a combination of antimicrobial medications, such as azithromycin and atovaquone (2).
The first case of human start highlightBabesia microti infectionend highlight acquired in the United States was identified in 1969 on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts (4). In 2011, babesiosis became a nationally notifiable condition. Where babesiosis is reportable, cases are reported to CDC by state health departments. Until now, CDC considered babesiosis to be endemic in seven states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin (5). In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended screening blood donations for Babesia in states where residents were considered to be at high risk for Babesia infection. As a result, FDA recommended blood donation screening in the following 15 states or jurisdictions: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia (6).
Previous studies have examined babesiosis transmission and found increasing case counts or rates in particular geographic areas, such as New York (7) in previous years (2011–2015) (4) and among specific populations, such as those enrolled in Medicare (8). The current study identifies trends in babesiosis in the United States during 2011–2019 and highlights establishment of endemic transmission in new geographic areas. Tracking babesiosis transmission over time provides important data to monitor the transmission risk in areas with and without endemic disease.
This analysis used data from the previously described national babesiosis surveillance system (4). These data included reported cases from the 41 states where babesiosis was reportable during 2011–2019 (5); data reported by the state of New York and New York City were merged and are referred to as New York. Trends were tracked over time by including in the analysis all states that met the following criteria: 1) data were submitted for the entire analytic time span (2011–2019), and 2) 10 or more babesiosis cases were reported for ≥2 consecutive years. Using these criteria, case data reported by Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin were included. Yearly incidence and overall percent rate change from 2011 to 2019 were calculated for each state. State babesiosis rates were modeled with Poisson regression. An overall model was fit, controlling for state, with year of diagnosis as a continuous variable. State-level models were also fit, controlling for event year (symptom onset or laboratory diagnosis date) as a continuous variable. The natural logarithm of the state’s census population for each year was used in the offset (a variable used when data are recorded over an observed period) to control for state population. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
During 2011–2019, a total of 16,456 cases of babesiosis were reported to CDC by 37 states, including 16,174 (98.2%) reported from the 10 states included in this analysis (Figure). New York reported the largest number of cases (4,738 total; average = 526.4 per year), followed by Massachusetts (4,136; 459.6), and Connecticut (2,200; 244.4). The lowest numbers of cases were reported in Vermont (114; 12.7) and New Hampshire (340; 37.8). Incidences ranged from 0.32 per 100,000 population in Vermont in 2011 to 18.0 in Rhode Island in 2015 (Table). The three states with the highest reported incidences were Rhode Island (18.0 per 100,000 population in 2015), Maine (10.3 in 2019), and Massachusetts (9.1 in 2019).
Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire experienced the largest percent change in incidence between 2011 and 2019. Vermont reported two cases in 2011 (incidence = 0.3 per 100,000 population) and 34 cases in 2019 (5.4), representing a 1,602% increase in incidence. Maine reported nine cases in 2011 (0.7) and 138 cases in 2019 (10.3), a 1,422% rate increase. Reported cases in New Hampshire increased from 13 in 2011 (1.0) to 63 in 2019 (4.6), a 372% rate increase. Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont reported significant changes in annual babesiosis incidence. Annual incidence did not change significantly in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Incidence trended upward in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont, whereas incidence in Minnesota and Wisconsin remained stable.

Discussion
Monitoring patterns of disease over time is critical to understanding regional changes in infection risk. Clinicians can use knowledge about current infection risk to aid in patient diagnoses, and public health authorities can base prevention activities on risk. Increasing babesiosis case counts and incidences have been documented in other smaller scale studies (4,7,8), but this report is the first comprehensive national surveillance assessment and multistate analysis of babesiosis over time. During 2011–2019, babesiosis incidence significantly increased in states with endemic transmission, as well as in certain neighboring states. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York reported the largest numbers of cases as well as significantly increasing incidences. The highest incidences have been reported from Rhode Island (18.0 cases per 100,000 population), Maine (10.3), and Massachusetts (9.2). Reported case counts in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont were similar to or higher than those in states previously identified as having endemic babesiosis, and annual incidences in these states have increased significantly.
Because case counts and rates have increased, clinicians need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of and risk factors for babesiosis in their practice areas, particularly as other tickborne conditions can have similar clinical manifestations, risk for disease acquisition, and geographic distribution (1). This awareness applies to states bordering those with endemic disease, where increased case counts and infection rates have been documented. Low numbers of cases have been reported from areas where no, or rare, sporadic cases of babesiosis had been reported, including the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario (9) as well as Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia (5).
The expansion of babesiosis risk could have implications for the blood supply. Babesia is transmissible via blood transfusion, and persons who acquire babesiosis through contaminated blood have been shown to have significantly worse health outcomes and a higher risk for death than do those who acquire the disease from a tick bite (1). Currently, the FDA recommends blood donation screening for babesiosis in 14 states and the District of Columbia (6). Babesiosis risk in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont is comparable to that in the northeastern and midwestern states where babesiosis has been considered endemic, and FDA guidance recommends blood donor screening for Babesia infection in those states (6). Ongoing evaluation of both tickborne and transfusion transmission risks in states that border those with endemic transmission is important for the evaluation and evolution of babesiosis blood screening policy.
The parasite B. microti has been identified in ticks within Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (3). Based on the increasing numbers of cases, trends in rates, and the parasite’s presence in ticks within the states, CDC now considers babesiosis to be endemic in these states.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, babesiosis is not reportable in all states; for example, although transmission of B. microti has been documented in Pennsylvania, babesiosis is not a reportable condition in that state (6,10). Second, these data probably do not represent all incident cases of babesiosis in reporting states. Patients with nonspecific symptoms might not be tested for babesiosis. Finally, cases are reported by the patient’s state of residence and might not always reflect the location where transmission occurred.
Members of the public and health care providers in states with endemic babesiosis and bordering states should be aware of the clinical signs of babesiosis and risk factors for Babesia infection. Persons spending time outdoors in states with endemic babesiosis should practice tick bite prevention, including wearing long pants, avoiding underbrush and long grass, and using tick repellents.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Incarcerated adults experience disproportionate negative health outcomes compared with the general adult population, including unintentional and violence-related injuries.
What is added by this report?
The proportion of nonfatal injury-related emergency department (ED) visits by incarcerated adults resulting from assault or self-harm was five times as high as those among nonincarcerated adults. Among incarcerated adults, men and persons aged <65 years had the highest proportions of assault-related ED visits. Falls accounted for the most ED visits among incarcerated adults aged ≥65 years. A higher proportion of ED visits by incarcerated women than incarcerated men was for overdose or poisoning.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Tailoring injury prevention efforts for incarcerated adults with age- and sex-specific strategies might reduce injuries and ED visits in this population.

During 2010–2019, U.S. correctional authorities held 1.4–1.6 million persons in state and federal prisons annually, and 10.3–12.9 million persons were admitted to local jails each year (1,2). Incarcerated persons experience a disproportionate burden of negative health outcomes, including unintentional and violence-related injuries (3,4). No national studies on injury-related emergency department (ED) visits by incarcerated persons have been conducted, but a previous study demonstrated a high rate of such visits among a Seattle, Washington jail population (5). To examine nonfatal injury-related ED visits among incarcerated adults, CDC analyzed 2010–2019 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) data. During 2010–2019, an estimated 733,547 ED visits by incarcerated adults occurred in the United States. The proportion of ED visits resulting from assault* and self-harm among incarcerated adults was five times as high as those among nonincarcerated adults. Among incarcerated adults, men and adult persons aged <65 years had the highest proportion of assault-related ED visits. Falls accounted for the most ED visits among incarcerated adults aged ≥65 years. A higher proportion of ED visits by incarcerated women than incarcerated men were for overdose or poisoning. These findings suggest that injuries among incarcerated adults differ from those among nonincarcerated adults and might require development and implementation of age- and sex-specific prevention strategies for this population.
NEISS-AIP collects data on patients treated in EDs for nonfatal injuries from a nationally representative, stratified probability sample of hospitals.† Data are weighted by the inverse probability of selection to provide annual national estimates. A visit by an incarcerated person was defined as an ED visit by a person aged ≥18 years who was transported to an ED from a jail or prison for an injury.§ A visit by a nonincarcerated person was defined as an ED visit by any other persons aged ≥18 years. Data include a narrative summarizing the circumstances of each visit written by a trained data abstractor. Specific terms within narratives were used to identify visits by incarcerated persons.¶ An iterative process was used to improve identification of visits by incarcerated persons through manual review of a sample of narratives by two authors to ensure that selected visits met the case definition and to identify additional terms.
The weighted number of ED visits among incarcerated and nonincarcerated adults were calculated using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.1; RTI International). Visits were stratified by patient sex, age group, injury intent, mechanism of injury,** and disposition,†† and the proportion of visits with these characteristics was calculated separately for incarcerated and nonincarcerated adults. Ratio of proportions (RPs) with 95% CIs were calculated to compare ED visits by incarcerated and nonincarcerated adults. Rao-Scott chi-square tests were used to calculate p-values, and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. SUDAAN Rlogist procedure was used to estimate RPs with 95% CIs by sex and age group among incarcerated adults. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§
During 2010–2019, an estimated 733,547 ED visits by incarcerated adults and 211,497,918 by nonincarcerated adults occurred in the United States (Table 1). Compared with ED visits among nonincarcerated adults, a higher proportion of ED visits among incarcerated adults were among men (83.7% versus 50.9%) and adults aged <45 years (77.1% versus 51.0%). The proportion of visits due to assault and self-harm was about five times as high among incarcerated adults (34.6% and 9.1%, respectively) than among nonincarcerated adults (6.5% and 1.9%, respectively). The most common mechanism of injury among incarcerated adults with an ED visit was being struck by or against an object (44.0%); among nonincarcerated adults, this mechanism accounted for 14.7% of ED visit injuries. The most common mechanisms of injury among nonincarcerated adults with an ED visit were “other” mechanisms (e.g., transportation-related injuries and drowning) (41.0%). A higher proportion of ED visits by incarcerated adults resulted in hospitalization or transfer to another hospital (17.3%) than did ED visits by nonincarcerated adults (13.2%).
Among incarcerated adults, the mechanism of injury for ED visits differed by age group (Table 2). When compared with ED visits by incarcerated adults aged ≥65 years, a higher proportion of ED visits by those aged 18–24 years resulted from being struck by or against an object or being cut or pierced, and a lower proportion of visits resulted from a fall. A higher proportion of ED visits by incarcerated adults aged 18–24 years was attributable to assault or self-harm compared with those by incarcerated adults aged ≥65 years. A lower proportion of ED visits in this youngest age group resulted in hospitalization or transfer to another hospital.
Reasons for ED visits by incarcerated adults also differed by sex (Table 3). Compared with ED visits by incarcerated men, a lower proportion of visits by incarcerated women resulted from being struck by or against an object, and a higher proportion were for fall-related injuries and overdose or poisoning. The proportion of ED visits attributable to assault by incarcerated women (20.0%) was lower than that by incarcerated men (37.4%).

Discussion
During the study period, an estimated 750,000 ED visits by incarcerated adults and >200 million by nonincarcerated adults occurred. The proportion of ED visits for assault and self-harm was five times as high among incarcerated adults than among nonincarcerated adults. A higher proportion of ED visits by incarcerated adults resulted from being struck by or against an object, compared with ED visits by nonincarcerated adults. Among incarcerated adults with injury-related ED visits, there were differences in injury mechanisms by age group and by sex. This study is the first to present national estimates of nonfatal injury-related ED visits by incarcerated adults in the United States.
A majority of ED visits among incarcerated adults were made by men and persons aged ≤45 years, likely reflecting the makeup of the incarcerated population (1,2). However, because older adults are the fastest growing segment of prison populations (6,7), it is notable that a higher proportion of ED visits for unintentional injuries, including falls, and a higher proportion of ED visits resulting in hospitalization occurred among incarcerated adults aged ≥65 years than occurred among younger incarcerated adults. A higher proportion of ED visits among incarcerated women were related to poisoning and falls, and a lower proportion were related to assault than were those by incarcerated men. These findings illustrate the importance of age- and sex-specific injury prevention strategies for incarcerated adults.
Approximately 50,000 assaults occurring within public correctional facilities are reported annually (7). Persons aged ≥18 years detained in jails were twice as likely to die by suicide in 2019 compared with persons in the overall U.S. adult population (8). The higher proportion of assault- and self-harm–related ED visits among incarcerated persons, particularly among younger adults and men, points to the need for the development and implementation of violence and suicide prevention strategies that consider the intersectional factors related to incarceration.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, there are differences in health care access for incarcerated persons, which might partially explain the observed differences. For example, some correctional facilities have the capacity to provide health care on-site, and therefore, a subset of injuries among incarcerated adults might not be represented in these findings. The decision to seek ED care is made by authorities rather than patients, which could affect the types of ED visits made by incarcerated persons and be biased toward more serious injuries. Second, it is unclear how the proximity of NEISS-AIP–participating hospitals to correctional facilities affects national estimates presented in this study. Third, classification of incarcerated status was based on text narratives written by NEISS-AIP data abstractors, which might have led to misclassification of incarceration status. Fourth, it was not possible to determine when the injury occurred for incarcerated cases; therefore, data include injuries that could have occurred before incarceration. Finally, data on race and ethnicity were not presented because these data in NEISS-AIP are incomplete; however, U.S. Department of Justice statistics consistently demonstrate that Black or African American men are disproportionately overrepresented in the correctional system (1,2) stemming from upstream factors, particularly structural racism (9), and are therefore likely overrepresented in these data.
Nearly one in every 100 persons in the United States is in a prison or jail (10), and this study found that characteristics of ED visits by incarcerated adults differ from those by nonincarcerated adults. These differences suggest that setting-appropriate risk-prevention strategies that account for the conditions experienced while incarcerated could help prevent injuries among incarcerated persons. Increased availability of community- and facility-level resources for comprehensive mental health services and creating protective environments could help mitigate the risk for self-harm and violence associated with incarceration. CDC has created technical packages and resources that outline evidence-based strategies for communities for preventing suicide,¶¶ interpersonal and community violence,*** overdose,††† and falls§§§; tailoring these strategies and developing interventions for the jail and prison setting with age-appropriate and sex-specific recommendations might reduce injuries and ED visits in this population.

§ ED visits among persons brought in by law enforcement before being booked in a jail or prison (e.g., immediately after arrest) or among persons who sustained an injury during detention-associated transportation were excluded from the case definition. Only persons brought directly to the ED from either a prison or a jail were included in this analysis. Injuries could have been sustained before incarceration. Occupational injuries were removed to exclude staff members injured while working in jails or prisons and were removed from nonincarcerated cases for consistency.
¶ “Jail,” “prison,” “corrections,” “correctional,” “incarcerate,” “incarcerated,” “incarceration,” “convict,” “inmate,” “detention,” “detain,” “detainee,” “detained,” and “police cell,” were used for inclusion, and other relevant search terms such as “custody,” “custody dispute,” “cell phone,” and “cellulitis” were used to help identify cases for exclusion.
** Injuries were categorized by intent (unintentional/undetermined, assault/legal intervention, or self-harm). Injuries were also categorized by mechanism of injury (fall, cut/pierce, struck by/against an object, inhalation/suffocation, overdose/poisoning, fire/burn, or other). Other includes injuries related to motor vehicles (occupant, motorcyclist, pedal cyclist, pedestrian, and other transport, which includes traffic-related, non–traffic-related, and unknown transportation injuries), overexertion, drowning/submersion, machinery, foreign body, dog bite, other bite/sting, firearm gunshot, bb/pellet gunshot, natural/environmental, other specified, and unknown/unspecified.
†† Disposition was categorized as treated and released, transferred to another hospital or hospitalized, or other. Other includes patients who left without being seen, left against medical advice, were held for observation, or had unknown disposition.

COVID-19 can lead to severe outcomes in children (1). Vaccination decreases risk for COVID-19 illness, severe disease, and death (2). On December 13, 2020, CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccination for persons aged ≥16 years, with expansion on May 12, 2021, to children and adolescents (children) aged 12–15 years, and on November 2, 2021, to children aged 5–11 years (3). As of March 8, 2023, COVID-19 vaccination coverage among school-aged children remained low nationwide, with 61.7% of children aged 12–17 years and approximately one third (32.7%) of those aged 5–11 years having completed the primary series (3). Intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine and vaccination coverage vary by demographic characteristics, including race and ethnicity and socioeconomic status (4–6). Seattle Public Schools (SPS) implemented a program to increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage during the 2021–22 school year, focusing on children aged 5–11 years during November 2021–June 2022, with an added focus on populations with low vaccine coverage during January 2022–June 2022.† The program included strategic messaging, school-located vaccination clinics, and school-led community engagement. Vaccination data from the Washington State Immunization Information System (WAIIS) were analyzed to examine disparities in COVID-19 vaccination by demographic and school characteristics and trends over time. In December 2021, 56.5% of all SPS students, 33.7% of children aged 5–11 years, and 81.3% of children aged 12–18 years had completed a COVID-19 primary vaccination series. By June 2022, overall series completion had increased to 80.3% and was 74.0% and 86.6% among children aged 5–11 years and 12–18 years, respectively. School-led vaccination programs can leverage community partnerships and relationships with families to improve COVID-19 vaccine access and coverage.
With support from local and state public health officials, SPS conducted school-located vaccination clinics at 54 schools during November 2021–June 2022. WAIIS provides monthly reports on school-required and COVID-19 vaccination coverage to SPS; these data are then linked to school system data. WAIIS data were analyzed to ascertain the monthly proportion of kindergarten through grade 12 students completing the primary COVID-19 vaccination§ series during December 2021–June 2022. The proportions of students completing the primary series were examined by age, race and ethnicity,¶ language status (monolingual versus multilingual),** use of special education services,†† school equity tier,§§ and school baseline vaccination coverage,¶¶ with January 2022 serving as a baseline for assessing subsequent activities to engage groups with low vaccination coverage. Qualitative and descriptive data regarding efforts by SPS to increase primary COVID-19 vaccination series completion during November 2021–June 2022 were also informally collected from approximately 10 SPS staff members and representatives of the Washington Department of Health and Public Health – Seattle & King County (PHSKC) via virtual meetings and e-mail. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***
SPS serves approximately 50,000 students in 106 schools (Table 1). In December 2021, primary COVID-19 vaccination series completion among SPS students aged 5–18 years was 56.5% overall (Figure) and was lowest among students who were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (27.9%) and multilingual (30.0%). During November–December 2021, 55 school-located vaccination clinics were held, with planning led by SPS and supported by PHSKC. These clinics included school day clinics, where children received immunizations with written parental consent but without requiring that a parent be present, and school-located regional clinics during evening or weekend hours. School-day clinics were strategically located at 41 schools selected because of size or known barriers to care.††† COVID-19 vaccines were also readily available at 29 PHSKC-supported school-based health centers that provide comprehensive primary care to their students.
By January 2022, primary COVID-19 vaccination series completion among SPS students aged 5–18 years had increased from 56.5% to 71.5%. After receipt of school-level student vaccination data in early January 2022, efforts during January–June 2022 focused on schools with continued low (baseline) vaccination coverage. Overall, 26 school-located vaccination clinics were conducted, including 19 during January–March 2022 that were in or near low-coverage schools (i.e., those with primary COVID-19 vaccine series completion rates of ≤50%). These clinics took place after school hours or on the weekend and were open to all SPS students and their family members. SPS administered 12,245 COVID-19 vaccine doses during November 2021–June 2022.
School-located vaccination clinics were complemented by strategies implemented to overcome cultural and linguistic barriers with families. For example, SPS conducted weekly communication with families, including email, telephone calls delivering prerecorded messages, and text messaging using TalkingPoints, a two-way communication platform that provided messaging in six languages.§§§ SPS also provided communications toolkits created by PHSKC in multiple languages to parent-teacher-student associations and community-based organizations to amplify messaging. Vaccine providers were selected based on their cultural competency (e.g., an independent, Black-owned pharmacy with vaccinators with facility in several African languages).
Tailored school-specific engagements were also conducted. One school used multilingual staff members from its school-based health center to administer vaccines at students’ homes or workplaces if necessary, thereby extending vaccination access beyond the school day. This school increased COVID-19 primary series completion among persons aged 11–21 years from 45% in January 2022 to 93% by June 2022. Another worked with a community health organization to organize health-related events focused on the Somali community and cohosted a school-located vaccination clinic with a local mosque. Each school used different approaches; however, all relied on school health staff members for direct family outreach.
During the period in which SPS specifically focused on students and schools with low baseline vaccination coverage, primary COVID-19 vaccination series completion among SPS students increased 12.3%, from 71.5% in January 2022, to 80.3% by June 2022; among children aged 5–11 years and 12–18 years, coverage increased 21.3% and 3.6%, respectively (Table 2). Primary series completion increased 37.8% among Black students (from 33.3% to 45.9%), 121.8% (from 13.5% to 29.9%) among those aged 5–11 years, and 14.8% (from 53.6% to 61.5%) among those aged 12–18 years. During the same period among multilingual students, overall primary series completion increased 38.7% (from 42.6% to 59.1%), 74.6% (from 28.9% to 50.4%) and 10.6% (from 65.7% to 72.3%) among those aged 5–11 and 12–18 years, respectively. Primary series completion among students at schools with low baseline vaccination coverage also increased, from 36.0% to 51.7% (43.4% increase) overall, from 34.8% to 51.1% (46.9% increase) among students aged 5–11 years, and from 51.9% to 58.5% (11.5% increase) among those aged 12–18 years.

Discussion
These data illustrate the potential impact of active school-based engagement on COVID-19 primary vaccination coverage among students. During the evaluation period, primary series completion in Washington among children aged 5–17 years (42.6%) was similar to national coverage in June 2022 (43.4%) (3,6). Primary series completion among children aged 5–17 years was higher in Seattle and King County (62.2%) than state-wide (42.6%); however, vaccination coverage among children aged 5–18 years in SPS (80.3%) exceeded this completion rate as well (7). Focused engagements during January–June 2022 to improve vaccination coverage might have contributed to high primary series completion among children attending SPS schools. Approaches included improved access via school-located vaccination clinics, outreach by school health professionals, and multimodal, multilingual communication from SPS. Coverage among all subgroups with low coverage in January 2022 significantly increased by June 2022, although overall completion remained lowest among Black and multilingual students.
Schools have the potential to play a critical role in the health of children, and can enhance access to health care services, including preventive care, particularly among those without a traditional medical home. Other studies have described the role of school-located vaccination clinics in increasing human papillomavirus and influenza vaccination coverage among students (8,9). School-located vaccination clinics can increase vaccination coverage by providing equitable access to vaccines but might be more effective when complemented with school-based messaging and other engagements to improve vaccine confidence.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, the intervention did not include a comparison group; thus, it is not possible to assess the relative contribution of these school-based activities to the changes in primary series completion described. Second, place of vaccination was not reported, and students might have been vaccinated at non-SPS vaccination sites. Third, monthly primary series completion data are cross-sectional, reflecting primary series completion for each subgroup at a single point in time; thus, the change in primary series completion for each subgroup cannot be attributed to individual change in behavior. Fourth, primary series completion data might be inaccurate or missing if students were vaccinated out of state. Fifth, caregivers of children in SPS might be more vaccine-confident compared with those in other U.S. populations, as suggested by high COVID-19 vaccination coverage in Seattle and King County (6). Finally, other interventions that affected vaccine confidence or access to care might not have been considered.
These findings illustrate and highlight the critical role that school health can play within the community. School health professionals are likely to be trusted by families (10). In this report, school health professionals collaborated with community and public health partners to implement strategic engagements and to facilitate opportunities for COVID-19 vaccination. School-led promotion of vaccination might improve vaccine confidence and provide support and readiness for current and future pandemics.

In May 2019, the Food and Drug Administration issued approval for Dengvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur), a live-attenuated, chimeric tetravalent dengue vaccine (1). In June 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended vaccination with Dengvaxia for children and adolescents aged 9–16 years with laboratory confirmation of previous dengue virus infection and who live in areas with endemic dengue transmission, such as the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI)† (2). Confirming previous dengue virus infection before vaccine administration (prevaccination screening) is important because 1) although Dengvaxia decreases hospitalization and severe disease from dengue among persons with a previous infection, it increases the risk for these outcomes among persons without a previous infection; 2) many dengue virus infections are asymptomatic; and 3) many patients with symptomatic infections do not seek medical attention or receive appropriate testing (3). Sufficient laboratory evidence of previous dengue virus infection includes a history of laboratory-confirmed dengue§ or a positive serologic test result that meets ACIP-recommended performance standards for prevaccination screening, defined as high specificity (≥98%) and sensitivity (≥75%). A seroprevalence of 20% in the vaccine-eligible population (corresponding to a positive predictive value of ≥90% for a test with minimum sensitivity of 75% and minimum specificity of 98%) is recommended to maximize vaccine safety and minimize the risk for vaccinating persons without a previous dengue virus infection (2).
The USVI Department of Health (VIDOH) requested assistance from CDC to determine the prevalence of previous dengue virus infection in children and adolescents within the age range eligible for dengue vaccination. During April–May 2022, a serosurvey was conducted that included children and adolescents in grades 3–7 enrolled in 15 schools. Schools were selected either through a one-stage cluster sampling design (10 schools) stratified by the two health districts in USVI (St. Thomas/St. John or St. Croix) with inclusion probabilities proportional to the size of third grade enrollment or through direct selection by VIDOH (five schools). All children and adolescents in the eligible grade levels at the selected schools were invited to participate. Children and adolescents with parental permission received testing for previous dengue virus infection using a dengue immunoglobin G rapid diagnostic test with 89.6% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity from approximately 5 μL of whole blood obtained by fingerstick (CDC, unpublished data, 2022). Design weights were computed from 10,000 simulations of the inclusion methodology, and then adjusted by raking to the two districts’ estimated population age and sex distributions from the 2022 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Weighted estimates of seroprevalence and 95% CIs were adjusted to reflect screening test performance. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶
Among 372 children and adolescents who received testing, 218 (59%) received a negative result, 152 (41%) received a positive result, and two received an indeterminate result (Table). Estimated seroprevalence was similar for males and females. The estimated seroprevalence was lowest in children aged 8 years (27%), and highest in those aged 12 years (69%). Seroprevalence was estimated to be higher in St. Thomas/St. John than in St. Croix. Among children and adolescents aged 9–13 years, the age group eligible for the dengue vaccine, estimated seroprevalence was 51%.
Dengue seroprevalence in USVI among age groups eligible for vaccination exceeds the 20% threshold that corresponds to a positive predictive value of ≥90% when implementing prevaccination screening with a test meeting ACIP-recommended performance standards. Dengue vaccination with prevaccination screening should be considered as part of a comprehensive dengue control and prevention strategy in USVI (3). Other U.S. jurisdictions with endemic transmission of dengue virus should evaluate the risks, benefits, and feasibility of incorporating the dengue vaccine into their local vaccine schedule and consider serosurveys to guide this evaluation.

On November 7, 2022, dengue virus (DENV), which is not endemic in the continental United States (1), was identified in a Maricopa County, Arizona resident by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing at Arizona State Public Health Laboratory (ASPHL). The patient (patient A) was admitted to a hospital on October 19 for a dengue-like illness, 7 days after traveling to and remaining in Mexicali, Mexico for <4 hours. Patient A was hospitalized for 3 days and subsequently recovered. Maricopa County Environmental Services Department (MCESD) conducted retrospective testing for DENV in samples collected from 21 mosquito pools located within 5 miles (8 km) of patient A’s residence during October 1–November 3. A sample collected from one mosquito pool (pool A) on October 5 was positive for DENV. Whole genome sequencing by CDC’s Dengue Branch later revealed that closely related DENV-3 strains not known to be circulating in the patient’s travel region were identified in both patient A and pool A, suggesting local DENV transmission.
Based on a preexisting, joint Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH), MCESD, and Arizona Department of Health Services locally acquired mosquitoborne disease response plan, MCDPH and MCESD activated an incident command office on November 10. MCDPH took the following actions: 1) prioritized prospective investigations of health care provider and laboratory reports of DENV and suspected arboviral visits queried from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program’s BioSense Platform (BioSense)*; 2) retrospectively reviewed confirmed, probable, and suspected dengue cases investigated during July 1–November 10 for evidence of local DENV transmission; 3) alerted health care providers of the possible local transmission; and 4) advised providers to test for and report suspected DENV to MCDPH. No evidence of local acquisition was identified in 13 suspected arboviral visits identified in the Biosense database, 10 reviews of closed cases, and 10 new case investigations. MCESD retrospectively tested samples collected during September 18–November 19 from an additional 4,299 mosquito pools located throughout the county, including the mosquito pools within 5 miles of patient A’s residence collected during the expanded testing time frame, for DENV by RT-PCR; all were negative.

After discussions with CDC’s Dengue Branch and Florida Public Health (2,3) regarding current best practices for managing locally acquired DENV infections, during November 17–19, MCDPH and MCESD canvassed residences within a 0.09-mile (150-m) radius (4) of patient A’s residence and pool A to interview residents, collect human specimens for DENV testing, and assess properties for mosquito breeding. Teams approached 241 households; residents of 72 households (29.9%) consented to environmental assessments, and 73 persons in 59 (24.5%) households were interviewed. Among these 73 interviewees, 12 (16.4%) reported onset of dengue-like symptoms within 14 days of their interview and received testing; all results were negative for DENV by RT-PCR at ASPHL. A serum enzyme immunoassay for DENV immunoglobulin M testing was performed by ASPHL on blood specimens from 53 (72.6%) interviewees; among these, one (1.9%) result was positive. CDC Arboviral Diseases Branch confirmed DENV-3 by plaque reduction neutralization testing. The person with the positive test result reported no travel during the 2 weeks preceding symptom onset. One of this person’s household members reported dengue-like symptoms but declined testing; both have since recovered. Environmental assessment of this residence identified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and breeding sites; mosquitoes collected in a professional BG-Sentinel mosquito trap§ tested negative for DENV by RT-PCR. The outbreak (consisting of two autochthonous DENV infections) ended January 4, 2023, after >45 days without additional locally acquired cases, as indicated by most recent guidance (4).
Coordinated surveillance and response activities identified the first locally acquired human DENV infections in Maricopa County, Arizona. Established partnerships and preexisting plans were essential to mounting a rapid, coordinated response to nonendemic arboviral transmission. MCDPH and MCESD will enhance future surveillance activities to identify and prevent autochthonous DENV transmission, including additional mosquito trap placement around patient residences and public mosquito exposure prevention education.¶ A countywide health care provider education campaign is being implemented to increase provider awareness of local DENV transmission and encourage testing for patients with compatible illness, irrespective of travel history.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), self-reported memory loss or confusion that is occurring more frequently, might be a symptom of early-stage dementia.
What is added by this report?
During 2015–2020, approximately 10% of adults aged ≥45 years reported SCD, with the highest prevalence among American Indian or Alaska Native adults (16.7%); prevalence declined with increasing formal educational attainment. Fewer than one half of persons with SCD had discussed their concerns about SCD with a health care professional.
What are the implications for public health?
Discussing changes in cognition with a physician is important to identifying potentially treatable conditions, obtaining early diagnosis and detection, developing support systems for caregivers, and establishing a treatment or care plan to help adults remain healthy and independent for as long as possible.

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported experience of worsening or more frequent memory loss or confusion, might be a symptom of early-stage dementia or future serious cognitive decline such as Alzheimer disease* or a related dementia (ADRD) (1). Established modifiable risk factors for ADRD include high blood pressure, inadequate physical activity, obesity, diabetes, depression, current cigarette smoking, and hearing loss (2). An estimated 6.5 million persons aged ≥65 years in the United States live with Alzheimer disease, the most common dementia (1). This number is projected to double by 2060, with the largest increase among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) adults (1,3). Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), CDC assessed racial and ethnic, select demographic, and geographical differences in SCD prevalence, and prevalence of health care professional conversations among those reporting SCD. The age-adjusted prevalence of SCD during 2015–2020 was 9.6% among adults aged ≥45 years (5.0% of Asian or Pacific Islander [A/PI] adults, 9.3% of non-Hispanic White [White] adults, 10.1% of Black adults, 11.4% of Hispanic adults, and 16.7% of non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN] adults). College education was associated with a lower prevalence of SCD among all racial and ethnic groups. Only 47.3% of adults with SCD reported that they had discussed confusion or memory loss with a health care professional. Discussing changes in cognition with a physician can allow for the identification of potentially treatable conditions, early detection of dementia, promotion of dementia risk reduction behaviors, and establishing a treatment or care plan to help adults remain healthy and independent for as long as possible.
BRFSS is a random-digit–dialed annual landline and cellular telephone cross-sectional survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults aged ≥18 years.† The BRFSS six-question cognitive decline optional module (4) was administered to adults aged ≥45 years by all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia at least once from 2015 to 2020; for states that implemented the module in multiple years, the most recent year of data was used.§ To maximize sample sizes for each racial and ethnic group,¶ data were aggregated for survey years 2015–2020. Overall telephone response rates** across survey years ranged from 45.9% (2017) to 49.4% (2019).
Respondents were classified as experiencing SCD if they responded “yes” when asked if they had experienced worsening or more frequent confusion or memory loss in the past 12 months; those who responded “yes” were asked if they had discussed SCD symptoms with a health care professional. Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; RTI International) to account for complex sample survey design and weighting. Unadjusted and age-adjusted prevalence of SCD by race and ethnicity were estimated among 215,406 study participants aged ≥45 years overall, and for groups defined by jurisdiction, sex, age, education, marital status, health insurance status, and access to a personal doctor. Estimates that did not meet reliability standards (relative SE <30%) were suppressed. T-tests with p-values <0.05 were used to denote significant differences between racial and ethnic groups and differences between groups by selected characteristics. This study was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††
Nearly 10% of adults aged ≥45 years (9.6%) reported experiencing SCD in the past 12 months (Table 1). SCD prevalence increased among successive age groups and was lower among adults with health insurance (9.5%) than among those without health insurance (11.6%) and decreased with increasing formal educational attainment. The highest overall percentages of SCD occurred among adults who did not have a high school diploma (16.4%), those who had been married, but were not currently married (13.6%), and those aged ≥75 years (13.3%). Age-adjusted SCD was higher among AI/AN (16.7%) and Hispanic adults (11.4%) than among White adults (9.3%) and was lower among A/PI adults (5.0%); prevalence among Black adults (10.1%) was similar to that among White adults (9.3%). This pattern of racial and ethnic differences was observed across most demographic subcategories examined. Unadjusted overall prevalence of SCD was highest in Alabama (14.3%), Oklahoma (14.1%), Florida (13.6%), Louisiana (13.6%), West Virginia (13.6%), Tennessee (12.9%), and New Mexico (12.8%), and lowest in Illinois 6.1% (Table 2). Because of small sample sizes, estimates for A/PI and AI/AN adults were unstable in most states.
Among 21,299 respondents with SCD, 47.3% reported talking with a health care professional about confusion or memory loss; women (50.7%) were more likely than men (43.3%) to do so (Table 3). Overall and within racial and ethnic groups, adults with SCD symptoms who were less likely to talk to a health care professional about their symptoms were aged ≥75 years, had less education, did not have health insurance, did not have a personal doctor, and had not visited a doctor in the past year.

Discussion
Prevalence of SCD varied across adults by demographic characteristics and race and ethnicity. Among racial and ethnic groups, SCD was lowest among A/PI adults and highest among AI/AN adults. Prevalence of SCD was higher among persons with less formal education than among college graduates across all racial and ethnic groups. This finding is consistent with other studies that suggest that persons with more years of formal education have a lower risk for dementia than do those with fewer years of formal education (5,6). Low prevalence of SCD among adults with higher education suggests that education might be protective against SCD. More research is needed to better understand the roles that education and related systemic factors play in sustaining cognitive health, particularly across diverse racial and ethnic populations. For example, modifiable risk factors for ADRD are less prevalent among adults with higher education, differ among racial and ethnic groups, and are associated with high prevalence of SCD (2).
The findings of this study can help health care providers identify groups of patients who would benefit from risk reduction behaviors and further cognitive assessment. Persons who talked with a health care professional about SCD were more likely to be women, had at least some college education, were aged <75 years, had a personal doctor, had a doctor visit within the past year, and had health insurance. Public health strategies are needed to support access to health care for persons who lack access to routine health care or to have a designated preventive health care professional. For example, programs such as Welcome to Medicare§§ and Medicare Annual Wellness Visit for adults¶¶ aged >65 provide coverage for preventive care screenings including cognitive assessments. Health care providers could consider asking patients as young as age 45 years about experiences of worsening memory loss or confusion during visits to initiate discussions about early signs of dementia and strategies to reduce risk and sustain cognitive health.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, sample sizes for some racial and ethnic groups were too small to detect statistical differences, particularly at the state level. Second, BRFSS represents the noninstitutionalized adult population only and therefore cannot be generalized to institutionalized adults. Finally, BRFSS data rely on self-report rather than medical examination records; survey questions about cognitive decline may be subject to recall and social desirability biases and responses may reflect cultural differences. However, the self-perception of cognitive decline has been shown to discriminate preclinical ADRD from normal aging (7).
Early detection and diagnosis are important to rule out conditions other than ADRD that might be treatable, and to establish a care plan to manage co-morbid conditions and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations. These potentially avoidable hospitalizations can be both costly and detrimental to quality of life, especially given that some persons with SCD are caregivers for others, which might affect the quality of care provided (8). Public health professionals can continue working to improve social determinants of health, conditions in places where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect risk for developing ADRD (9). Although dementia might not be preventable for some, the risk for developing dementia for others can be delayed or reduced through early interventions and public health education including heart-healthy lifestyles, protecting the head from traumatic brain injury, and engaging in social activities (1,2,10). The Building Our Largest Dementia Infrastructure Act (BOLD), charges CDC with strengthening the dementia and dementia caregiving public health infrastructure.*** BOLD Public Health Centers of Excellence on Risk Reduction, Early Detection, and Caregiving are national resources to public health departments in reaching populations at greatest risk for ADRD and their caregivers. States and organizations participating in the National Healthy Brain Initiative and BOLD Public Health Programs††† are strengthening the public health infrastructure utilizing the Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map Series§§§ and implementing strategies for reducing dementia in populations with known and widening disparities through programs such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.¶¶¶ Public health professionals can use these strategies to reduce risks for dementia in at-risk populations within their jurisdictions.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is associated with an approximately 60% reduction in the risk for female-to-male transmission of HIV. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, through CDC and other organizations, has supported VMMC for HIV prevention in eastern and southern Africa. During 2010–2016, CDC supported 5,880,372 VMMCs performed in 12 countries.
What is added by this report?
During 2017–2021, CDC supported an additional 8,497,297 VMMCs performed in 13 countries in eastern and southern Africa. Compliance with postoperative follow-up visits within 14 days of VMMC was high, and use of device-based circumcisions remains low.
What are the implications for public health practice?
CDC’s continued support of the VMMC program is a critical component to ending the AIDS epidemic and reaching the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 2025 target of 90% of eligible males having access to VMMC in prioritized countries.

In 2007, voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) was endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS after it was found to be associated with approximately a 60% reduction in the risk for female-to-male transmission of HIV (1). As a result of this endorsement, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), through partnerships with U.S. government agencies, including CDC, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development, started supporting VMMCs performed in prioritized countries in southern and eastern Africa. During 2010–2016, CDC supported 5,880,372 VMMCs in 12 countries (2,3). During 2017–2021, CDC supported 8,497,297 VMMCs performed in 13 countries. In 2020, the number of VMMCs performed declined 31.8% compared with the number in 2019, primarily because of COVID-19–related disruptions to VMMC service delivery. PEPFAR 2017–2021 Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting data were used to provide an update and describe CDC’s contribution to the scale-up of the VMMC program, which is important to meeting the 2025 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) target of 90% of males aged 15–59 years having access to VMMC services in prioritized countries to help end the AIDS epidemic by 2030 (4).
VMMC programs are incorporated into national HIV prevention portfolios. Services include voluntary HIV testing, HIV risk reduction education, screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, and linkage to care and treatment for clients who receive a positive HIV test result. During 2017–2021, CDC supported VMMC programs in 13 countries: Botswana, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Not all of these countries were supported by CDC during the entire 5-year period.*
VMMC programs report indicators to the PEPFAR Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting database every quarter in accordance with the U.S. government fiscal year† (5). This analysis includes the annual number of CDC-supported VMMCs performed, as well as the following indicators: client age group, HIV test results among males who underwent testing at VMMC sites, attendance at postoperative follow-up visits within 14 days, and type of circumcision method (use of a WHO pre-qualified circumcision device as method of circumcision or traditional surgical technique). Age was categorized as <15 years, 15–29 years, and ≥30 years. The prevalence of HIV-positivity was calculated by dividing the number of males who received a positive test result for HIV by the number of males who underwent HIV testing at VMMC sites. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software (version 16; StataCorp). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§
During 2017–2021, CDC supported 8,497,297 VMMCs in 13 countries (Table) (Figure). During 2017–2019, the number of CDC-supported VMMCs increased annually, with a mean annual increase of 13.5%. During 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of VMMCs declined 31.8%, from 2,120,797 in 2019 to 1,447,147, with further reductions during 2021. During 2017–2019, 43.8% of all VMMCs were performed in clients aged 10–14 years and 45.7% in clients aged 15–29 years; the proportion performed in clients aged 15–29 years increased to 61.0% during 2020 and to 86.6% during 2021. Most (74.2%) VMMC clients participated in HIV testing services at VMMC sites; this proportion declined from 86.4% in 2017 to 48.7% in 2021.¶ Among the 5,595,239 males who underwent testing for HIV at VMMC sites, 44,745 (0.8%) received a positive result. HIV-positivity ranged from 0.4% in 2020 to 1.2% in 2021.
Among all VMMC clients during 2017–2021, 90.8% returned for a follow-up visit within 14 days. Postoperative follow-up visits increased among all countries from, 86.2% in 2017 to 96.7% in 2021. Two percent (166,475) of all circumcisions were performed using a device; this proportion was highest (3.8%) in 2017, declined annually until 2020, then increased from 1.1% in 2020 to 2.2% in 2021.

Discussion
Overall, substantial progress has been made in scaling up CDC-supported VMMC programs, with 8,497,297 VMMCs performed during 2017–2021. Increased programmatic experience in VMMC scale-up and the continued prioritization of VMMC by ministries of health and global stakeholders have contributed to this progress. The decreased number of VMMCs performed during 2020 was largely related to mitigation measures implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, in 2020, based on 2015–2018 data showing that certain severe adverse events associated with VMMC, while very rare, were higher among clients aged 10–14 years (2.9 per 100,000 procedures) than among clients aged ≥15 years (1.6 per 100,000 procedures), PEPFAR increased the age eligibility for VMMC to ≥15 years (6). This change in age eligibility likely contributed to the increase in the proportion of VMMCs performed in persons aged 15–29 years during 2020 and 2021.
During 2017–2021, a total of 44,745 males who underwent testing at a VMMC site received a positive HIV test result. VMMC sites serve as an important entry point for HIV testing; without this opportunity, many cases of HIV infection among males might go undiagnosed. The decrease in HIV testing at VMMC sites in 2020 and 2021 was likely due to changes in testing approaches after the 2019 PEPFAR recommendations to provide targeted testing including screening for clients at higher risk for HIV (7). VMMC postoperative follow-up visits increased in all countries during 2017–2021. The percentage of males who returned for a postoperative follow-up visit within 14 days exceeded the recommended 80%, which helped to facilitate timely detection of an adverse event. To reduce the transmission of COVID-19, many countries conducted virtual follow-up visits during 2020. In 2021, PEPFAR supported this approach based on evidence from the scientific literature and programmatic success (8).
VMMC programs can use WHO-prequalified male circumcision devices which typically includes application of a device for removal of the foreskin, as an alternative to traditional surgical circumcision techniques. The overwhelming majority of VMMCs are still performed through conventional surgical methods; the decision to introduce a circumcision device is country-specific, with many programs still piloting use of the devices. Device-based circumcisions declined from 3.8% during 2017 to 1.1% during 2019 and 2020; one factor contributing to the decline might be the lack of programmatic experience to scale up use of the ShangRing device (Wuhu Snnda Medical Treatment Appliance Technology) when practitioners started to phase out the PrePex device (Circ MedTech, Ltd.) during 2016–2018 after reports of tetanus in patients who received VMMC with this device (9). During 2021, more programs scaled up device-based circumcisions, and their use increased to 2.2% from 1.1% during 2020.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, only CDC-supported VMMC results are reported, so the actual number of VMMCs performed might be higher than that reported here. Second, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting data are subject to reporting and data entry errors. Finally, the data used for this analysis cannot be used to directly assess progress towards reaching the goal of 90% of eligible males having access to VMMC services.
Modeling analyses have estimated that the 26.8 million PEPFAR-supported VMMCs performed during 2008–2019 in prioritized countries have helped prevent 340,000 new HIV infections; this estimate is projected to increase to 1.8 million by 2030, given that VMMC provides a lifelong reduction in HIV risk (10). CDC’s continued support of the VMMC program is a critical component of ending the AIDS epidemic and reaching the UNAIDS 2025 target of 90% of eligible males having access to VMMC in prioritized countries (4). Prioritization of uncircumcised males living in areas of high HIV incidence and those at highest risk for HIV can maximize VMMC’s contribution to HIV epidemic control.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Molecular HIV clusters provide evidence of rapid transmission.
What is added by this report?
In 2021, molecular HIV analysis in Georgia identified clusters of rapid HIV transmission among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in metropolitan Atlanta. A multicomponent investigation identified factors that might limit access to HIV services, including language barriers, immigration- and deportation-related concerns, and sexuality-related cultural norms. Health departments, providers, and community-based organizations collaborated to address these barriers.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Hispanic MSM can face important barriers to accessing HIV services. Detecting and responding to HIV clusters among MSM can mobilize resources to strengthen services and improve health equity.

During February 2021–June 2022, the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) detected five clusters of rapid HIV transmission concentrated among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in metropolitan Atlanta. The clusters were detected through routine analysis of HIV-1 nucleotide sequence data obtained through public health surveillance (1,2). Beginning in spring 2021, GDPH partnered with health districts with jurisdiction in four metropolitan Atlanta counties (Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett) and CDC to investigate factors contributing to HIV spread, epidemiologic characteristics, and transmission patterns. Activities included review of surveillance and partner services interview data,† medical chart reviews, and qualitative interviews with service providers and Hispanic MSM community members. By June 2022, these clusters included 75 persons, including 56% who identified as Hispanic, 96% who reported male sex at birth, 81% who reported male-to-male sexual contact, and 84% of whom resided in the four metropolitan Atlanta counties. Qualitative interviews identified barriers to accessing HIV prevention and care services, including language barriers, immigration- and deportation-related concerns, and cultural norms regarding sexuality-related stigma. GDPH and the health districts expanded coordination, initiated culturally concordant HIV prevention marketing and educational activities, developed partnerships with organizations serving Hispanic communities to enhance outreach and services, and obtained funding for a bilingual patient navigation program with academic partners to provide staff members to help persons overcome barriers and understand the health care system. HIV molecular cluster detection can identify rapid HIV transmission among sexual networks involving ethnic and sexual minority groups, draw attention to the needs of affected populations, and advance health equity through tailored responses that address those needs.

Investigation and Results
In February 2021, GDPH identified three HIV clusters among Hispanic MSM using molecular analysis of HIV-1 nucleotide sequence data collected through routine surveillance (1). In Georgia, clusters are inferred using a genetic distance threshold of 0.005 nucleotide substitutions per site among persons with HIV infection diagnosed during the most recent 3 years, with priority clusters defined as those that include four or more diagnoses during the most recent 12 months. This definition is consistent with evidence of rapid HIV transmission (1,3). These were the first priority clusters in Georgia comprising ≥40% Hispanic persons. GDPH analysis of HIV surveillance data demonstrated that during 2014–2019, HIV diagnoses among Hispanic adolescents and adults in four metropolitan Atlanta counties increased from 38.9 to 47.1 per 100,000 persons.
After demonstration of persistent growth of the clusters through early 2021, GDPH reviewed partner services interview data and attempted direct outreach to all persons in clusters, including those previously interviewed. However, response was limited, partly attributed to immigration- and deportation-related concerns and limited numbers of bilingual staff members.
In October 2021, CDC began providing remote assistance in analyzing epidemiologic data for investigation activities, and GDPH initiated review of medical charts of persons in clusters. Among 38 persons with available charts, 10 (26%) were primarily Spanish-speaking, and 12 (32%) were from Latin American countries; five (13%) had mental health diagnoses, including depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder.
In February 2022, GDPH requested CDC assistance in conducting a qualitative assessment with Hispanic MSM community members and service providers to identify barriers to accessing medical and social services and HIV care, as well as simplifying cluster data synthesis and visualization. CDC provided support during March–July 2022. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§
By June 30, 2022, GDPH detected two additional clusters that included ≥40% Hispanic persons, with additional persons identified among all clusters throughout the investigation period (Figure). The five clusters included 75 persons with HIV, with clusters ranging in size from four to 45 persons. The median age of persons in clusters was 29 years (range = 16–54 years), 56% identified as Hispanic, 96% were assigned male sex at birth, and 81% reported male-to-male sexual contact (Table). Overall, 84% of persons lived in one of the four metropolitan Atlanta counties. Forty percent of diagnoses were from facilities with infectious disease providers who specialize in HIV care, 27% in primary or urgent care settings, 13% in inpatient or emergency department settings, and 11% at health departments. Eighty-five percent of persons in these clusters were virally suppressed¶; however, new diagnoses continued to be identified throughout the investigation (Figure).
By June 30, 2022, among 52 persons in clusters eligible for partner services interviews,** 34 (65%) were interviewed, 16 (31%) could not be reached, and two (4%) declined. Among those interviewed, 20 (59%) reported meeting partners online, and four (12%) reported ever having taken HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
CDC and health department staff members conducted qualitative interviews with 28 Hispanic MSM and one transgender woman in the four counties and 28 individual or group interviews with 65 medical and social service providers who treated persons in clusters or served Hispanic MSM. Community members were recruited by provider referral, social media, and at bars and clubs. Because multiple attempts had already been made to reach persons in clusters for partner services interviews, further attempts to conduct qualitative interviews were not made for persons in clusters.
Interviewed participants identified barriers to accessing medical and social services, including few Spanish-speaking staff members, limited Spanish language materials, and fear of deportation and other immigration-related concerns. Participants also reported barriers to accessing HIV prevention and care, including stigma toward MSM and persons with HIV because of sexuality-related cultural norms, low levels of awareness about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections because of limited primary care access, limited provision of HIV services in primary and urgent care settings, and limited Hispanic MSM-focused community outreach and marketing.
Top
Public Health Response
Response activities have included establishing routine coordination meetings between GDPH and metropolitan Atlanta health districts and presenting reports on the investigation to HIV community advisory boards and planning councils. Health districts disseminated Spanish-language HIV prevention materials emphasizing service availability irrespective of immigration status via social media and at venues in zip codes where persons in clusters reside. GDPH established new partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs) serving Hispanic communities and developed strategies to increase the number of bilingual staff members, including modifying job postings to prioritize hiring bilingual personnel. Health departments and CBOs partnered with academic institutions to engage in implementation science research and obtained federal funding for a culturally concordant outreach and patient navigation program for status-neutral sexual health services. A status-neutral approach provides persons with and without HIV access to comprehensive medical services, including HIV prevention and treatment, and social services depending on their needs.†† In addition, in June 2022, the local health districts launched an at-home HIV and sexually transmitted infection self-testing program.§§ GDPH is continuing to partner with CDC to implement informatics tools to simplify cluster investigations.

Discussion
The detection of multiple HIV clusters among Hispanic MSM in metropolitan Atlanta provided evidence of rapid, ongoing HIV transmission and resulted in a multifaceted response involving health departments, CDC, health care providers, and CBOs. The response identified barriers to accessing HIV services among Hispanic MSM in metropolitan Atlanta. Although most persons in clusters had evidence of viral suppression, which prevents sexual HIV transmission, as of June 30, 2022, the clusters were still expanding. This finding indicates potential ongoing transmission among a larger network, which could include persons with undiagnosed HIV infection.
This investigation highlighted the value of molecular HIV cluster detection and response for identifying gaps in services among networks of MSM. Although most large HIV outbreak responses in the United States have focused on persons who inject drugs, male-to-male sexual contact is the primary mode of HIV transmission in most molecular clusters (4,5). This investigation demonstrated that cluster detection and response can detect rapid HIV transmission and identify population-level gaps in systems involving MSM.
Barriers to accessing HIV services among Hispanic MSM in this investigation included language barriers and immigration- and deportation-related concerns; stigma toward MSM and persons with HIV, often tied to sexuality-related cultural norms; and lack of HIV prevention services in primary and urgent care settings. These findings align with studies identifying access to HIV prevention and care services, language, traditional notions of masculinity, and medical mistrust as barriers to HIV prevention among Hispanic MSM (6,7). When HIV clusters are detected, it is important to gather data to identify gaps in HIV services so that response efforts can strengthen services for affected populations. Although gaps might already be known, collaborative response efforts can clarify the most important gaps and catalyze new efforts to overcome them such as those described in this response.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, qualitative interviews were conducted among Hispanic MSM community members; thus, findings might not directly reflect the experience of persons in the clusters. Second, because HIV testing and diagnoses substantially declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, cluster size might be underestimated (8). Finally, because surveillance and chart review data were incomplete, the proportion of persons in clusters born outside the United States or who were Spanish-speaking might also be underestimated.
This investigation highlights important barriers to and inequalities in HIV prevention services experienced by Hispanic MSM in Georgia because of issues related to language, immigration- and deportation-concerns, and sexuality-related cultural norms. HIV molecular cluster detection has the capability to identify rapid HIV transmission in a new demographic group and advance health equity through expanded and tailored resources for HIV prevention and care.

During fall 2022, a resurgence of invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infection in children and adolescents was observed in two of CDC’s Emerging Infections Program (EIP)* surveillance sites: Colorado (Denver metropolitan area) and Minnesota (entire state). This increase followed historic declines in invasive bacterial diseases during 2020, concurrent with mitigation strategies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic† (1). Whereas reports of iGAS increased among all age groups, including adults, the increase among children and adolescents was notable, occurred earlier than seasonal increases during previous years, and accompanied a resurgence in hospitalizations for respiratory viral illnesses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. Viral infections, such as influenza and varicella, have been identified as risk factors for iGAS infection in children, adolescents, and adults (2) and can be reduced by vaccination.
Surveillance for iGAS is conducted by 10 U.S. sites as part of EIP’s Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs).§ An analysis of cases among Colorado and Minnesota EIP site residents aged <18 years who met criteria for iGAS¶ was conducted using ABCs data from the Colorado and Minnesota surveillance sites. Case counts, age distribution, and clinical characteristics of patients with iGAS infection were compared over three periods: baseline (January 1, 2016–December 31, 2019), pandemic (January 1, 2020–December 31, 2021), and recent increase (October 1–December 31, 2022). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**
During October 1–December 31, 2022, a combined total of 34 cases was reported in the Colorado and Minnesota ABCs sites. In comparison, a 3-month average of 11 cases and four cases were observed during the same period in 2016–2019 and 2020–2021, respectively. Colorado patients identified during the recent increase were younger (median age = 3.1 years) than were those during the baseline period (5.6 years) and the pandemic period (6.2 years); this was not observed in Minnesota (median age = 4.0, 6.0, and 6.5 years in the baseline, pandemic, and recent increase periods, respectively). Two deaths (one each in Colorado and Minnesota) were noted during the recent increase period; overall, during 2016–2021, five deaths occurred (one in Colorado and four in Minnesota). Frequency of intensive care unit admission and length of hospital stay were similar during the recent increase (35.3% [12 of 34 patients]; 4.5 days) and baseline periods (34.4% [62 of 180], 5.0 days).†† Most cases (73.5% [25 of 34]) that occurred during the recent increase were in children and adolescents without underlying medical conditions.
Among the 34 cases that occurred during the recent increase, 21 (61.8%) patients had an upper respiratory tract infection noted within the 2 weeks preceding their iGAS infection, six (17.6%) reported sore throat, and seven (20.6%) reported no preceding illness. Fifteen (44.1%) patients received positive test results for one or more respiratory viral pathogen during the 2 weeks before, or concurrent with, their iGAS infection. Viral respiratory pathogens identified included RSV (six, 17.6%), influenza A or B (six, 17.6%), and SARS-CoV-2 (three, 8.8%).§§ Comparison of pediatric iGAS case counts, and influenza and RSV hospitalization rates during 2016–2022 showed an increase in iGAS infections coinciding with seasonal peaks in RSV and influenza hospitalization rates during most years except in 2021, when influenza and RSV hospitalizations were lower than those in previous or subsequent years (Figure).
Among the 26 (76%) iGAS cases from the recent increase period with M protein gene¶¶ (emm) typing results available, 22 (85.0%) were type 1 (nine, 34.6%) or type 12 (13, 50.0%); these were also the two most common types detected during the baseline period (55.1% type 1; 17.9% type 12). Whole genome sequencing results did not indicate changes in predicted antibiotic susceptibility (3) compared with earlier years or expansion of a single clone. Twenty-three isolates were predicted to be susceptible to all antimicrobials; one type 12 isolate was resistant to erythromycin, and two type 77 isolates were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline.
The increase in pediatric iGAS cases reported during fall 2022 is important for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of iGAS (1). Increased activity of respiratory viruses, in combination with reduced exposure to GAS and associated development of protective immunity to common emm types during the COVID-19 pandemic (4), might have predisposed children to iGAS infection when pandemic restrictions were lifted. The proportion of patients with preceding or concurrent influenza infections suggests that influenza vaccination might reduce the risk for iGAS, as has been demonstrated for varicella vaccination (5). Clinicians should consider iGAS as a possible cause of severe illness in children, adolescents, and adults, particularly among patients at increased risk,*** and offer influenza and varicella vaccination to eligible persons who are not up to date.

In the report “Vaccination Coverage with Selected Vaccines and Exemption Rates Among Children in Kindergarten — United States, 2021–22 School Year,” multiple errors occurred. On page 26, in the eighth line of the first paragraph, the sentences should have read, “Nationwide, vaccination coverage with 2 doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) was 93.0%¶; with the state-required number of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) doses was 92.7%**; with poliovirus vaccine (polio) was 93.1%††; and with the state-required number of varicella vaccine doses was 92.8%.§§ Compared with the 2020–21 school year, vaccination coverage decreased 0.8–0.9 percentage points for all vaccines. Although 2.6% of kindergartners had an exemption for at least one vaccine,¶¶ an additional 4.4% who did not have an exemption were not up to date with MMR.”
On page 27, in the fifth line of the first paragraph, the sentences should have read, “During the 2021–22 school year, immunization programs reported 3,835,130 children enrolled in kindergarten in 49 states and the District of Columbia.¶¶¶ Reported estimates are based on 3,536,546 (92.2%) children who were surveyed for vaccination coverage, 3,686,775 (96.1%) surveyed for exemptions, and 2,527,578 (65.9%) surveyed for grace period and provisional enrollment status.” Also on page 27, in the first line of the second column, the sentences should have read, “Nationally, 2-dose MMR coverage was 93.0% (range = 78.0% [Alaska] to ≥98.6% [Mississippi]), with coverage of ≥95% reported by 14 states and <90% by nine states and the District of Columbia (Table). DTaP coverage was 92.7% (range = 78.0% [Alaska] to ≥98.6% [Mississippi]); coverage of ≥95% was reported by 15 states and of <90% by 12 states and the District of Columbia. Polio vaccination coverage was 93.1% (range = 77.1% [Alaska] to ≥98.6% [Mississippi]), with coverage of ≥95% reported by 14 states and <90% by 10 states and the District of Columbia. Varicella vaccination coverage nationally was 92.8% (range = 76.1% [Alaska] to ≥98.6% [Mississippi]), with 13 states reporting coverage ≥95% and nine states and the District of Columbia reporting <90% coverage.” Also on page 27, in the third line of the third paragraph in the second column, the sentences should have read, “Nationwide, 4.4% of kindergarten students were not fully vaccinated and not exempt. Among the 35 states and the District of Columbia with MMR coverage <95%, all but four could potentially achieve ≥95% MMR coverage if all nonexempt kindergartners who were within a grace period, provisionally enrolled, or otherwise enrolled in school without documentation of vaccination were vaccinated (Figure 2).”
On page 28, the Table contained multiple errors. In the first row, labeled “National estimate,” the value under the column heading “Kindergarten population” should have been 3,835,130, the value under the heading “2 Doses MMR” should have been 93.0, the value under the heading “5 Doses DTaP” should have been 92.7, and the value under the heading “4 Doses polio” should have been 93.1. In the 28th row, labeled “Mississippi,” the value under the column heading “Kindergarten population” should have been 36,524; the value under the heading “2 Doses MMR” should have been ≥98.6; the value under the heading “5 Doses DTaP” should have been ≥98.6; the value under the heading “4 Doses polio” should have been ≥98.6; the value under the heading “2 Doses VAR” should have been ≥98.6; and the value under the heading “Grace period or provisional enrollment, %” should have been 1.0.
On page 29, the last two sentences in the 13th footnote should have read, “****Data reported from 3,536,546 kindergartners were assessed for coverage, 3,686,775 for exemptions, and 2,527,578 for grace period or provisional enrollment. Estimates represent rates for populations of coverage (3,835,130), exemptions (3,835,130), and grace period or provisional enrollment (2,604,872).”
On page 30, in the 13th line of the first paragraph, the sentences should have read, “MMR coverage of 93.0% translates to approximately 250,000 kindergartners who are potentially not protected against measles; clusters of unvaccinated and undervaccinated children can lead to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.” Also on page 30, in the fourth line of the second paragraph, the sentence should have read, “Nationwide, 4.4% of kindergarten students were not fully vaccinated with MMR and not exempt, and this percentage increased in most states compared with 2020–21.”
On page 30, in Figure 1, the line for “MMR, 2 doses” for 2021–2022, should have indicated a value of 93.0%.
On page 31, in Figure 2, the bar for “MMR coverage” among kindergartners for Mississippi should have indicated a value of 98.6%. The bar for “MMR not up to date and no exemption” for kindergartners in Delaware should have indicated a value of 2.4%, and for South Carolina, should have indicated a value of 4.6%.
On page 32, in the Summary box, the second line in the second paragraph should have read, “An additional 4.4% without an exemption were not up to date with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.”
Supplementary materials have also been corrected.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Diethylene glycol (DEG)–contaminated medications present a global health threat, especially in low-income countries.
What is added by this report?
A large cluster of acute kidney injury cases affecting children in The Gambia in 2022 was associated with case fatality rates >80%. The implicated syrup-based pediatric medications that had been administered to patients were imported from a single Indian manufacturer. This is one of the first documented DEG outbreaks in which contaminated medications were imported rather than being domestically manufactured.
What are the implications for public health practice?
DEG mass poisonings continue to occur worldwide, especially in low-resource settings. Strengthened international pharmaceutical regulatory structures and event-based surveillance systems can help prevent DEG-associated large-scale poisoning events.

Table 1
Table 2
On July 26, 2022, a pediatric nephrologist alerted The Gambia’s Ministry of Health (MoH) to a cluster of cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) among young children at the country’s sole teaching hospital, and on August 23, 2022, MoH requested assistance from CDC. CDC epidemiologists arrived in The Gambia, a West African country, on September 16 to assist MoH in characterizing the illness, describing the epidemiology, and identifying potential causal factors and their sources. Investigators reviewed medical records and interviewed caregivers to characterize patients’ symptoms and identify exposures. The preliminary investigation suggested that various contaminated syrup-based children’s medications contributed to the AKI outbreak. During the investigation, MoH recalled implicated medications from a single international manufacturer. Continued efforts to strengthen pharmaceutical quality control and event-based public health surveillance are needed to help prevent future medication-related outbreaks.

Investigation and Results
In July 2022, a pediatric nephrologist at the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital in The Gambia’s capital city of Banjul alerted MoH to a cluster of AKI cases among children. Data on AKI incidence are not routinely collected in The Gambia; thus, the baseline AKI rate was unknown. However, the treating nephrologist expressed concern that the number of cases and deaths were well above baseline: through August 12, a total of 30 pediatric deaths among 37 AKI cases had been reported from facilities throughout the country (case fatality rate = 81%). In response to a request for assistance, a multidisciplinary CDC team, including an epidemiologist, an anthropologist, an infectious disease physician, and an environmental health scientist, arrived on September 16 to assist the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) and MoH in characterizing the illness and identifying exposures. MoH collaborated separately with the World Health Organization (WHO) to test medications that might have been used by patients.
Active surveillance was conducted through reoccurring communication with the teaching hospital and other regional hospitals, inquiring about admissions of pediatric patients with kidney failure. As of September 29, 2022, MoH had identified 78 clinically suspected AKI cases. Among these patients, 66 (85%) had died. Most patients (75%) were aged <2 years, and 60% were male. Cases were reported from six of the country’s seven health regions.* Among the 78 cases reported to MoH, symptom onset date was available for 67 (86%) (Figure).
CDC, MoH, and FETP investigators developed a standardized case report form to gather data about pediatric patients with AKI identified by MoH. Data collection consisted of a review of the patient’s medical records and caregiver interview data. For this investigation, a confirmed case of pediatric AKI was defined as anuria (no urine output) of unknown etiology in a child aged ≤8 years, persisting for ≥24 hours, during June 21–September 29, 2022. June 21 was chosen as the start date because medications suspected to have possibly caused the AKI outbreak had been imported into the country on June 21. Investigators first reviewed the medical records of 52 (67%) of the 78 MoH-identified patients with suspected AKI who were treated by the teaching hospital. Next, interviews with at least one caregiver of each of 27 patients were conducted by investigators in local languages, including the caregivers of 20 patients whose children’s hospital medical records were reviewed and seven patients whose medical records could not be located. Investigators selected a convenience sample of caregivers for interview based on their location of residence. Because of resource limitations and reluctance on the part of some caregivers to be interviewed, not all medical records could be located, and not all invited caregivers participated. In addition, interview data were collected in only two of the six health regions (Western Regions 1 and 2). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
Caregivers were asked about the child’s recent medical history, including disease course, experiences with the health care system, and possible exposures, including medications, foods, and experience of flooding, among others. All participating caregivers were interviewed in their homes. All four (15%) living patients whose caregivers were interviewed had been discharged at the time of interview. Among patients who had died, the mean interval between date of death and date caregivers were contacted for interview was 33 days. Information from medical records and interviews was used to determine whether patients on the MoH line list met the confirmed case definition. After data from the 27 caregiver interviews and 52 medical record reviews were combined, 59 case report forms were completed, representing 76% of the 78 cases reported to MoH, and 88% of the 67 patients with a symptom onset date. Among these 59 patients, 56 (95%) met the confirmed case definition and were included in the analysis.§
Among the 56 included patients, more than one half (54%) experienced fever as their first signs or symptoms, and 50% experienced vomiting (Table 1). Approximately one third (34%) had diarrhea or loose stool as the first symptom. During the course of illness, all patients experienced anuria and fever, 95% experienced vomiting, and 73% experienced diarrhea. Nearly one half (48%) experienced anorexia or reduced feeding. The median interval from symptom onset to anuria was 5 days (IQR = 2–7 days); among the 26 patients who died, the median interval from onset of anuria to death was 6 days (IQR = 3–7 days).
Abnormal laboratory test results were received by 66%–100% of patients, including impaired renal and liver function, thrombocytosis, and mild to moderate anemia (Table 2). Fourteen patients underwent peritoneal dialysis, and one patient underwent hemodialysis; all 15 patients who received dialysis died.
Among the 26 patients with a caregiver interview, 100% of caregivers reported that the child consumed a prescription or over-the-counter syrup-based medication (including paracetamol, known in the United States as acetaminophen, commonly administered for fever) before the onset of anuria. Twelve patients (47%) had consumed four or more medications before being hospitalized. Although many caregivers were unable to recall the names of medications that they administered to their children, caregivers of 14 (54%) of these 26 patients identified the manufacturer name of at least one medication administered to their child before inpatient hospitalization. A single international manufacturer that produced a syrup-based medication was reported in eight of 14 (57%) interviews in which caregivers identified the manufacturer name of at least one medication administered to their child before inpatient hospitalization.
Top
Public Health Response
Preliminary reports from the treating physicians at the teaching hospital indicated that caregivers had administered paracetamol and promethazine to their children before their development of AKI. Based on this information, MoH advised the public to suspend use of all paracetamol and promethazine syrups on September 7, 2022, and September 16, 2022, respectively (Figure). The laboratory analysis of 23 medication samples conducted by MoH and WHO confirmed that four products from Maiden Pharmaceuticals Limited (Haryana, India) contained diethylene glycol (DEG) and ethylene glycol (EG). Based on records from The Gambia’s Medicines Control Agency, all medications that tested positive for DEG and EG were imported into The Gambia on June 21, 2022, shortly before the occurrence of the first AKI cases.
On October 4, 2022, MoH suspended the importation of all medications from this manufacturer and requested that health care providers stop prescribing, dispensing, and using medications produced by this manufacturer because of their possible contamination. On October 5, 2022, WHO issued a worldwide medical product alert for four syrup-based medications from Maiden Pharmaceuticals (1). In collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, ChildFund The Gambia, and The Gambia Red Cross Society, MoH supported a house-to-house recall and collection of all products from this manufacturer in addition to all paracetamol, promethazine, and cough syrups. In conjunction with the recall, MoH promoted awareness about the contaminated medications through messaging on radio, television, social media, and in places of worship. MoH also commenced ongoing pharmacy spot checks to ensure that products from this manufacturer were not being sold. Surveillance officers were trained in case definitions, case report forms, following up with patients discharged from hospitals, and conducting active case finding in the community.

Discussion
This investigation strongly suggests that medications contaminated with DEG or EG imported into The Gambia led to this AKI cluster among children. AKI outbreaks associated with DEG-contaminated pharmaceutical products have been documented in Panama, Nigeria, India, and Haiti (2–5). Patients with DEG poisoning can experience a range of signs and symptoms, including altered mental status, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms; however, the most consistent manifestation is AKI, characterized by oliguria (low urine output) or anuria, progressing over 1–3 days to renal failure (indicated by elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen) (6). In past DEG outbreaks, manufacturers have been suspected of substituting DEG in the place of more expensive, pharmaceutical-grade solvents (3,7). Medication testing supported contaminated medical syrups as the etiology of this cluster of AKI cases (1).
Further support for a toxic etiology includes the wide geographic distribution of cases in the country (six of seven health regions), a common pharmaceutical manufacturer of medications reported to have been used by many patients, and a low rate of intrahousehold spread. This intoxication appears to have only affected children, likely because medications in syrup form are most commonly used for children in The Gambia.
Factors that might have led to poor caregiver recall regarding medications administered to their children include the assumption by caregivers that medications would not harm their children, difficulty of parents of children who had died recalling administered medications owing to the interval between patients’ deaths and the investigation, and the possibility of reduced reporting following the issuing of health alerts by MoH.
This likely poisoning event highlights the potential public health risks posed by the inadequate quality management of pharmaceutical exports. Among reports of AKI associated with DEG-contaminated medical products, this is the first in which DEG-contaminated medications were imported into a country, rather than being domestically manufactured. Inadequate regulatory structures make the sale of medications from international markets an especially high-risk activity in low-resource settings. Medications for export might be subject to less rigorous regulatory standards than those for domestic use (8). Simultaneously, low-resource countries might not have the human and financial resources to monitor and test imported drugs (8). In addition to improving pharmaceutical quality management, efforts should be made by MoH to strengthen event-based surveillance systems (9), which rely on unstructured information (e.g., reports, rumors, and other information) to detect unusual events that might signal an outbreak or other public health event. Event-based surveillance complements traditional reportable disease surveillance and has the potential to improve the ability to rapidly detect and respond to similar acute health events of unknown and unexpected etiologies. FETP-trained experts can provide valuable assistance in these and other efforts to help governments improve their capacities to detect and respond to outbreaks in the future.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Infections caused by Cronobacter sakazakii are rare but can cause severe illness and death in infants.
What is added by this report?
Whole genome sequencing analysis was used to link one case of Cronobacter sakazakii infection in a full-term infant to an opened can of powdered infant formula, and another unrelated fatal case in a premature infant to contaminated breast pump equipment.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increased awareness of the widespread presence of Cronobacter in the environment, along with promotion of safe preparation and storage of powdered infant formula, and careful cleaning and sanitization of breast pump equipment, could prevent potentially devastating infections.

Cronobacter sakazakii, a species of gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, is known to cause severe and often fatal meningitis and sepsis in young infants. C. sakazakii is ubiquitous in the environment, and most reported infant cases have been attributed to contaminated powdered infant formula (powdered formula) or breast milk that was expressed using contaminated breast pump equipment (1–3). Previous investigations of cases and outbreaks have identified C. sakazakii in opened powdered formula, breast pump parts, environmental surfaces in the home, and, rarely, in unopened powdered formula and formula manufacturing facilities (2,4–6). This report describes two infants with C. sakazakii meningitis reported to CDC in September 2021 and February 2022. CDC used whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis to link one case to contaminated opened powdered formula from the patient’s home and the other to contaminated breast pump equipment. These cases highlight the importance of expanding awareness about C. sakazakii infections in infants, safe preparation and storage of powdered formula, proper cleaning and sanitizing of breast pump equipment, and using WGS as a tool for C. sakazakii investigations.
In September 2021, a state public health department reported an infant with C. sakazakii infection to CDC (patient A). In February 2022, a physician reported another case to CDC and a different state health department (patient B). CDC was invited to participate in the investigations and distributed case report forms to obtain detailed feeding information about the two cases. Patient isolates and environmental samples were sent to CDC, state public health laboratories, and other federal agencies for isolation, identification, and WGS analysis of C. sakazakii.
The first case occurred in September 2021 in a full-term (gestation of 40 weeks, 1 day) male infant (patient A) born to a healthy mother who had an uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. At age 14 days, the infant was evaluated at hospital A for fever, irritability, and excessive crying, oral candidiasis (thrush), and diaper dermatitis. Before his illness, he was fed both expressed breast milk and powdered formula. A lumbar puncture was performed, and C. sakazakii was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The infant was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous antibiotics for 21 days; he made a full recovery with no apparent long-term sequelae (Table).
A C. sakazakii isolate from the CSF was analyzed by WGS. Samples of opened powdered formula and an opened bottled water container used for formula preparation in the patient’s home were cultured in gram-negative enrichment broth followed by selective media. C. sakazakii isolates were recovered from both the powdered formula and the water container. WGS* was performed and identified two distinct strains of C. sakazakii (Figure). Sequence reads were cleaned,† assembled,§ and analyzed using high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis¶; results showed that the patient isolate was closely genetically related to an isolate from the powdered formula (0 SNPs apart).** A second isolate from the same can of powdered formula was closely genetically related to an isolate from the water container (within 4 SNPs).†† These two strains were not related to one another (>50,000 SNPs apart). Federal partners tested unopened powdered formula from the same lot as the powdered formula consumed by the patient; C. sakazakii was not detected.
The second case occurred in February 2022 in a preterm (gestation of 30 weeks, 6 days), hospitalized male infant (patient B) born by cesarean delivery because of breech presentation and the mother’s worsening preeclampsia. At the time of illness onset, he was being treated in the neonatal intensive care unit for complications of prematurity but was stable, feeding, growing, and breathing without respiratory support. He was fed expressed breast milk fortified with liquid human milk fortifier primarily through an orogastric tube before becoming ill. At age 20 days, he experienced apneic and bradycardic episodes, temperature elevation, and a requirement for respiratory support. Seizures developed the following day. C. sakazakii was isolated from blood and CSF cultures. Despite treatment with intravenous antibiotics and repeat negative blood cultures, the patient died 13 days after illness onset.
Expressed milk samples, breast pump parts from two separate devices (one used in the hospital and one used in the mother’s home), and liquid human milk fortifier samples from three lots were cultured in gram-negative enrichment broth followed by selective media; C. sakazakii was recovered from the breast pump parts used in the home. An interview revealed that these breast pump parts were cleaned in a household sink, sanitized, and sometimes assembled while still moist. No bacteria were recovered from the expressed milk samples, liquid human milk fortifier samples, hospital breast pump parts, or unopened powdered formula from the hospital. C. sakazakii isolates from the patient’s blood and CSF, and those isolated from environmental samples, were analyzed by WGS,§§ which indicated that the patient’s CSF and blood isolates were closely genetically related to the isolate recovered from the home breast pump (0–1 SNPs).

Discussion
On the basis of the WGS analysis, these two cases of C. sakazakii infection in infants were not related. One case was likely transmitted by powdered formula prepared in the home, and the other through expressed milk contaminated by breast pump equipment. These cases illustrate the ubiquity of the pathogen in the environment, the importance of hygiene in preventing C. sakazakii infections, and the utility of WGS as a method for determining genetic relatedness and probable transmission sources. Understanding more about the sources of these infections can help educate clinicians and caregivers about ways to prevent C. sakazakii infections among infants.
C. sakazakii can cause meningitis and sepsis, most commonly in very young infants and those with a history of prematurity, possibly because of immaturity of their immune systems and gastrointestinal tracts (7). Although C. sakazakii infections are treatable with antibiotics, they often have devastating outcomes, with death occurring in nearly 40% of infants who develop meningitis (2). Many surviving infants also experience complications, including cerebral abscess and hydrocephalus, which can result in permanent neurologic sequelae (2). Because C. sakazakii infection is not a nationally notifiable condition, the actual incidence is unknown. However, it is estimated that approximately 18 cases of invasive C. sakazakii infection in infants occur annually in the United States, most of which are not associated with outbreaks but likely occur because of isolated instances of contamination of infant feeding products and equipment in the home (2,8).
Previous investigations have identified C. sakazakii in opened powdered formula because of its notable ability to survive in dry environments. However, it has also been recovered from many other environmental sources in the home, including kitchen sink surfaces, pacifiers, bottles, household utensils, vacuum cleaning bags, and other foods (1,2). Feeding utensils, such as scoops used for powdered formula, can become contaminated on countertops or in sinks and subsequently transfer C. sakazakii when reintroduced into the formula. Additional reports have linked C. sakazakii infections to contaminated expressed breast milk after recovering the organism from breast pump equipment (3–5). Phenotypic methods of identification and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis have previously been used to identify Cronobacter species and determine potential sources of transmission in cases of infant C. sakazakii infections in the United States. However, these methods were limited and could not definitively identify genetic relatedness. Analysis of WGS data from these two cases permitted more accurate determinations of relatedness among isolates. In future investigations, WGS can be used to guide public health practitioners and clinicians about potential outbreaks or sources of C. sakazakii related to illnesses.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, C. sakazakii infections are not nationally notifiable or reportable in most states, so associations with other strains and detection of potential outbreaks is currently limited. Second, standardized methods for identifying and characterizing C. sakazakii are not yet routine, further limiting wide-scale detection and surveillance efforts. Finally, on-site investigations were not performed, so the samples tested might not represent all potential sources of contamination (e.g., additional feeding products, equipment, or environmental surfaces).
Because of the widespread presence of C. sakazakii in the environment, caregivers of infants should follow safe hygiene, preparation, and storage practices, and learn steps to protect infants from infection. Clinicians providing care for infants aged <2 months or those who were born prematurely or are immunosuppressed should explain the risks of C. sakazakii infection to caregivers, especially if the infant is fed with powdered formula or expressed milk. Education should emphasize exploring alternatives to powdered formula for infants at highest risk and safe powdered formula preparation and storage (9). In addition, caretakers should be instructed to thoroughly clean and sanitize breast pump equipment (10). Hospitals caring for premature or critically ill infants might consider providing instructions and a dedicated basin for cleaning supplies at home upon hospital discharge to minimize the risk of contamination. Increased awareness of safe hygiene, preparation, and storage practices related to infant feeding products, enhanced understanding of C. sakazakii reservoirs, and ongoing public health messaging can help prevent infant C. sakazakii infections, complications, and deaths.

During the 2022 multinational outbreak of monkeypox (mpox), transmission occurred primarily through skin-to-skin contact, including through sex. Persons experiencing homelessness have been disproportionately affected by severe mpox.
What is added by this report?
Among 209 surveyed persons accessing homeless services or staying in encampments in San Francisco, California, without self-reported vaccination or reported previous mpox infection during October 25–November 3, 2022, three had detectable antiorthopoxvirus immunoglobulin (Ig) G or IgM, consistent with possible undetected mpox infection.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Possible undetected mpox among persons experiencing homelessness during the 2022 mpox outbreak highlights the need for tailored outreach strategies that ensure interventions such as prevention messaging and vaccination reach persons experiencing homelessness.

Monkeypox (mpox) is a disease caused by an Orthopoxvirus. The 2022 multinational outbreak, which began in May 2022, has spread primarily by close skin-to-skin contact, including through sexual contact. Persons experiencing homelessness have been disproportionately affected by severe mpox (1). However, mpox prevalence and transmission pathways among persons experiencing homelessness are not known, and persons experiencing homelessness have not been specifically recommended to receive mpox vaccine during the 2022 outbreak (2,3). During October 25–November 3, 2022, a CDC field team conducted an orthopoxvirus seroprevalence survey among persons accessing homeless services or staying in encampments, shelters, or permanent supportive housing in San Francisco, California that had noted at least one case of mpox or served populations at risk. During field team visits to 16 unique sites, 209 participants completed a 15-minute survey and provided a blood specimen. Among 80 participants aged <50 years who did not report smallpox or mpox vaccination or previous mpox infection, two (2.5%) had detectable antiorthopoxvirus immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody. Among 73 participants who did not report mpox vaccination or previous mpox infection and who were tested for IgM, one (1.4%) had detectable antiorthopoxvirus IgM. Together, these results suggest that three possible undetected mpox infections occurred among a sample of persons experiencing homelessness, highlighting the need to ensure that community outreach and prevention interventions, such as vaccination, are accessible to this population.
During July–October 2022, the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) identified cases of mpox among persons who were experiencing homelessness (Deborah Borne, MD, San Francisco Department of Public Health, personal communication, October 2022). SFDPH invited a CDC field team to conduct an orthopoxvirus seroprevalence survey among persons experiencing homelessness to better understand the prevalence of disease and possible transmission pathways. Existing collaboration between SFDPH and government- and community-based organizations serving persons experiencing homelessness facilitated site engagement in the project. Homeless service sites were prioritized for inclusion if they had provided services to at least one person with confirmed mpox or served persons at increased risk for mpox, including those identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer; men who have sex with men; and persons who engage in sex work.
Participants provided oral consent to respond to a 15-minute orally administered survey and to provide a serum specimen. Persons aged ≥18 years were eligible to participate. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics and behaviors that could be related to mpox transmission in the context of homelessness, including frequency of sharing objects such as clothing and utensils as well as sexual activity and drug use in the preceding month. Surveys were conducted in person in English or Spanish or through a phone-based language interpreter if another language was requested. A trained phlebotomist performed venipuncture. When venipuncture was unsuccessful or when success was considered unlikely (e.g., because of needle aversion or inadequately visualized or damaged veins), participants were offered use of a microneedle device that passively collected capillary blood from the upper arm (4). Each participant received up to two $25 grocery store gift cards for participating in the survey and blood collection. This activity was reviewed and approved by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
Blood specimens were centrifuged in serum separator tubes and shipped to CDC for processing. All serum specimens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for presence of antiorthopoxvirus IgG. Those specimens with detectible IgG or from participants who reported higher mpox risk behaviors (sex work, multiple sexual partners, and persons assigned male at birth who identified as gay, bisexual, or transgender), were tested for IgM (5). Possible undetected mpox infection was defined as 1) detectable antiorthopoxvirus IgG (optical density minus cutoff value [OD-COV] ≥0.1) in a participant aged <50 years without reported smallpox or mpox vaccination or 2) detectable antiorthopoxvirus IgM (OD-COV ≥0.1) in a participant without reported mpox vaccination. Possible undetected infections identified by IgG testing were restricted to persons aged <50 years to avoid inclusion of participants who received smallpox vaccine during childhood. Participants who reported unknown vaccination history or previous mpox infection were not included as having possible undetected mpox infections. Descriptive analyses were performed, and outcomes were reported by vaccination history and serologic results.
The CDC field team recruited 284 participants from 16 unique sites (seven shelters, five service centers, two supportive housing locations, and two encampments); 11 (4%) participants were excluded from analysis because they reported living in their own private residence without accessing homeless services during the preceding month. Among the remaining 273 participants, 240 (88%) consented to blood collection, and blood was successfully collected from 209 (77%) (Table 1). Average participant age was 46 years; 69% reported male sex at birth, 59% reported male gender, and 9% were transgender. Most (77%) were heterosexual. The highest proportion of participants was non-Hispanic White (38%), followed by non-Hispanic Black or African American (32%); 70% were non-Hispanic. The most common recruitment sites were shelters (46%), followed by homeless service sites (33%).
A total of 207 participants were included in serologic analysis, after exclusion of two participants (1%) who reported both previous mpox infection and mpox vaccination (Table 2). Among these participants, 82 (40%) reported previous vaccination against smallpox, mpox, or both, including 50 (24%) who reported only smallpox vaccination, 22 (11%) who reported only mpox vaccination, and 10 (5%) who reported both. Neither smallpox nor mpox vaccination was reported by 117 (60%) participants; vaccination status of eight (4%) was unknown. Among the 32 participants who reported any mpox vaccination, 26 (81%) reported receiving 1 dose, and six (19%) reported receiving 2 doses.
Among 50 participants who reported only smallpox vaccination, antiorthopoxvirus IgG was detected in 19 (38%) and IgM in one (3%). Among 22 participants who reported only mpox vaccination, antiorthopoxvirus IgG was detected in 12 (55%) and IgM in four (21%). Among 80 participants aged <50 years who did not report smallpox or mpox vaccination, two (3%) had detectable antiorthopoxvirus IgG. Among 68 participants without reported mpox vaccination who were tested for antiorthopoxvirus IgM, one (1.5%) had detectable antibodies. These results yielded a total of three possible undetected mpox infections.
None of these three participants reported sexual contact during the preceding month, being transgender, being a gay or bisexual man, or having a rash at the time of the survey (Table 3). Among the three participants with possible undetected mpox infection, two reported that during the previous month they had shared unwashed utensils, spent time around and touched someone with a rash, and shared smoking devices.
Top
Discussion
Among 207 persons who were experiencing homelessness or accessing homeless services in San Francisco and voluntarily participated in an antiorthopoxvirus seroprevalence survey during a large multinational mpox outbreak, three possible undetected mpox infections were detected. Mpox infections might be undetected because of subclinical, atypical, or mild disease or because of barriers to seeking or accessing health care systems, which could have occurred among the participants in this survey. None of the participants with possible undetected mpox infections reported sexual contact during the preceding month, although some reported sharing utensils and smoking devices and spending time around or touching someone with a rash. However, the timing of mpox exposure among these three persons is not known and could have preceded the survey period. The transmission route for the three possible undetected mpox infections could not be determined; additional studies are needed to identify mpox transmission pathways among persons experiencing homelessness. In the current outbreak, mpox has primarily spread through sexual activity but can be spread through touching contaminated objects and through close personal contact outside of sexual activity, although this risk is considered to be lower (6).
Previous mpox vaccination was reported by 16% of survey participants. However, only 54% of participants reporting mpox vaccination had detectable antiorthopoxvirus IgG, and 21% had detectable IgM. A 2-dose mpox vaccination series is recommended to optimize immunity (7). Most participants who received mpox vaccine reported receiving a single dose, which might in part explain the lower seroprevalence (2,7). SFDPH and community partners collaborated to conduct pop-up vaccination events in San Francisco during September–December 2022 for persons experiencing homelessness; this active outreach approach can be further leveraged to better facilitate complete vaccination for eligible persons. A single mpox vaccine dose might still offer some protection against severe mpox-associated illness and hospitalization, for which persons experiencing homelessness (1,7,8) might be at higher risk.
The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, participants were recruited as a convenience sample at prioritized locations; therefore, the findings are not generalizable to the entire population of persons experiencing homelessness or accessing homeless services in San Francisco. Second, the sample size was small because of time and resource limitations as well as logistical challenges associated with collecting blood samples from persons in encampments and at homeless service sites (9). Third, because of the small numbers of participants with potential undetected infection, statistical analyses could not be conducted to further refine possible transmission routes. Fourth, the survey ascertained frequency of behaviors during the preceding month to improve recall; however, it was not possible to determine whether behaviors that would increase mpox transmission risk were present outside that time frame. Fifth, the orthopoxvirus ELISA does not detect antibodies specific to Monkeypox virus; therefore, previous or acute mpox infection among the participants could not be distinguished from other orthopoxvirus infections or previous vaccination. Sixth, the survey relied on self-reported vaccination history and behaviors, which can be subject to recall and social desirability biases. Finally, it is possible for antibody testing to produce false-positive results. Efforts to improve specificity of possible mpox infection included restricting IgG results to persons aged <50 years to avoid inclusion of participants who received childhood smallpox vaccine, asking about previous military service to avoid inclusion of participants who received smallpox vaccination in the service, and using a higher OD-COV in ELISA tests to reduce risk for false-positive results (5,10). However, participants close to the cutoff age of 50 years could have received childhood smallpox vaccine, as was the case of one participant without reported vaccination history who had detectable antiorthopoxvirus IgG.
These findings suggest that undetected mpox infections might have occurred among a small percentage of persons experiencing homelessness in San Francisco. It is still unknown whether unique mpox transmission pathways exist for persons experiencing homelessness. However, given that known and possible undetected mpox transmission occurred, and that severe mpox disease among persons experiencing homelessness is possible (1), accessible prevention measures are needed. Prioritization and inclusion in public health response planning, focused outreach, and on-site vaccination events can ensure that prevention measures reach persons experiencing homelessness.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
During the 2022 global monkeypox (mpox) outbreak, some patients have experienced severe clinical manifestations. Medical countermeasures (MCMs) developed to treat smallpox have been used to treat mpox.
What is added by this report?
Data relevant to the use of tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir, trifluridine ophthalmic solution, and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous were reviewed. Animal models, MCM use for human cases of related orthopoxviruses, unpublished data, input from clinician experts, and experience during CDC mpox consultations were also evaluated to develop interim clinical treatment considerations.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Until data from controlled studies are available, these interim clinical considerations facilitate strategic decision-making about the use of MCMs to manage specific severe manifestations of mpox.

Monkeypox (mpox) is a disease caused by infection with Monkeypox virus (MPXV), an Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) in the same genus as Variola virus, which causes smallpox. During 2022, a global outbreak involving mpox clade IIb was recognized, primarily among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.* Most affected patients have been immunocompetent and experienced ≤10 rash lesions (1). CDC has recommended supportive care including pain control.† However, some patients have experienced severe mpox manifestations, including ocular lesions, neurologic complications, myopericarditis, complications associated with mucosal (oral, rectal, genital, and urethral) lesions, and uncontrolled viral spread due to moderate or severe immunocompromise, particularly advanced HIV infection (2). Therapeutic medical countermeasures (MCMs) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–regulated drugs and biologics that are predominantly stockpiled by the U.S. government; MCMs developed for smallpox preparedness or shown to be effective against other OPXVs (i.e., tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir, trifluridine ophthalmic solution, and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous [VIGIV]) have been used to treat severe mpox. During May 2022−January 2023, CDC provided more than 250 U.S. mpox consultations. This report synthesizes data from animal models, MCM use for human cases of related OPXV, unpublished data, input from clinician experts, and experience during consultations (including follow-up) to provide interim clinical treatment considerations. Randomized controlled trials and other carefully controlled research studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of MCMs for treating human mpox. Until data gaps are filled, the information presented in this report represents the best available information concerning the effective use of MCMs and should be used to guide decisions about MCM use for mpox patients.
During May 2022, a global mpox outbreak was identified. A CDC clinical team began providing consultations§ to U.S. clinicians caring for patients with mpox, developing guidance and other online clinical resources for health care providers, and issuing health alerts¶ when emerging clinical concerns (e.g., severe infections in patients with advanced HIV infection) were detected. Before the 2022 outbreak, CDC experts in poxviruses and associated MCMs had evaluated efficacy data from animal models and reports of MCM use for a few human cases of related OPXV infections (e.g., vaccinia virus and cowpox virus). This information and unpublished data shared by intergovernmental partners guided initial clinical consultations; as more knowledge was acquired through clinical consultations, many of which involved repeated consultations and regular follow-up, CDC’s approach to mpox cases was refined. Recurrent questions that would benefit from expert input were identified (e.g., management of ocular infections); input was solicited from external experts in infectious diseases (including HIV), immunology, neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and public health emergency response. Identified experts included leaders of professional societies and physicians experienced in treating mpox during the current outbreak. Partners from the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise,** a U.S. intragovernmental committee that optimizes preparedness for public health emergencies (e.g., through developing and stockpiling available MCMs), were also consulted. This report is a comprehensive synthesis of the compiled evidence and is intended to foster strategic decision-making rather than serve as a prescriptive treatment guideline. Clinical considerations were developed in the context of limited data about MCM effectiveness during the current outbreak, finite supplies of some MCMs (e.g., VIGIV and intravenous [IV] tecovirimat), and a need to incorporate evolving data and clinical observations into guidance that can be used to manage cases, including in future months if case counts increase. The rationale for specific guidance is included.

MCMs Being Used to Treat Mpox and Indications for Use
MCMs for OPXV infections include antivirals (i.e., tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir, and trifluridine ophthalmic solution) and VIGIV. Tecovirimat, brincidofovir, and VIGIV are recommended based on efficacy data from experimental animal models involving exposure to diverse OPXVs (i.e., variola, mpox, vaccinia, ectromelia, and rabbitpox viruses), albeit via the respiratory route, which is different from the close skin and mucosal contact associated with the ongoing mpox outbreak. Cidofovir and trifluridine ophthalmic solution are recommended because of their successful use treating other viral infections; cidofovir is also recommended based on data on the effectiveness of brincidofovir. All four antivirals were sporadically used to treat severe manifestations of human OPXV infections before the 2022 global outbreak (3–7); VIGIV has been used to treat adverse events from live, replicating vaccinia virus vaccines that are licensed to prevent smallpox (e.g., progressive vaccinia after receipt of Dryvax§§ or ACAM2000¶¶), and was used to treat smallpox disease before its 1980 worldwide eradication (8–11). Despite this real-world use, it is not known how often MCMs were associated with favorable outcomes and whether clinical improvements were due to MCMs, natural resolution of illness, or a combination of these.
MCMs have been widely used during the 2022 outbreak. As of February 2023, tecovirimat and VIGIV continue to be available through CDC-sponsored expanded access Investigational New Drug (IND) protocols; brincidofovir through an FDA–authorized single-patient emergency use IND; and cidofovir and trifluridine, commercially. To date, no data have shown whether MCMs are beneficial, including for pain control (irrespective of severity). Most persons recover with supportive care alone (including pain control***). MCMs (particularly tecovorimat) used without close monitoring could result in suboptimal drug levels and promote drug resistance,††† thereby reducing its effectiveness for the individual patient and others. In addition, the effectiveness of MCMs for the treatment of mpox has not been systematically evaluated. For these reasons, CDC strongly encourages enrollment in clinical trials (e.g., the National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded Study of Tecovirimat for Human Mpox [STOMP] trial).§§§
Severe mpox might manifest as hemorrhagic disease, many confluent or necrotic lesions, severe necrotizing or obstructive lymphadenopathy (e.g., of the upper airway), obstructive edema (e.g., of the gastrointestinal tract), extradermatologic manifestation (e.g., pulmonary nodules, encephalitis, myopericarditis, and ocular infections), and sepsis (12). Some patients might not have severe mpox at the time of first health care interaction but are at risk for severe mpox because of underlying medical condition (e.g., severe or moderate immunocompromise)¶¶¶ or presence of lesions on certain surfaces (e.g., penile foreskin, urethral meatus, or vulva). These might predispose patients to complications such as strictures or edema which could require procedures including urethral catheterization, colostomy, or surgical debridement. MCMs should be considered in these cases irrespective of patient immune status. Children and adolescents aged <18 years and pregnant persons have accounted for a small percentage (<0.3%) of total U.S. cases during the current outbreak, and when affected, have experienced mild illness (13,14); however, because these populations (particularly children aged <8 years) have historically experienced more severe clade I mpox infections, and because outcomes in pregnant women and neonates during the current outbreak might not be known for several months, case-by-case consideration of MCMs should be undertaken after weighing the potential benefits and harms.**** Other populations might also benefit from case-by-case consideration of MCM use. Persons with a history of atopic dermatitis and eczema (both well-controlled and not) might experience uncontrolled viral spread, possibly as a result of associated defects in the innate or adaptive immune response (15). Persons with extensive breaks in the dermal barrier (e.g., from burns, impetigo, varicella zoster virus infections, herpes simplex virus infection, severe acne, severe diaper dermatitis with extensive denuded skin, psoriasis, and Darier disease [keratosis follicularis]) might also be at risk for severe manifestations of uncontrolled viral spread depending on the severity of the underlying condition (16).

Approach to Using MCMs to Treat Mpox
Through iterative consultations, a management algorithm outlining the approach to patients with suspected, probable, or confirmed mpox has been developed to aid in decision-making regarding the earliest use of effective MCMs when indicated (Figure). Coinfections (e.g., with syphilis, herpes simplex, varicella zoster, or molluscum contagiosum) should be considered. All patients with suspected mpox should be evaluated for preexisting immunocompromising conditions and be tested for HIV. No antiviral MCMs for use against OPXVs are virucidal, and optimal immune function is essential to recovery, irrespective of whether multiple MCMs are administered. Antiviral MCMs might complement the immune response by reducing replication, maturation, or spread of OPXVs. VIGIV might provide some level of passive immunity to certain patients with moderate or severe immunocompromise until a patient’s immune system is able to clear the virus. However, earliest optimization of immune function (e.g., by temporarily delaying or decreasing doses of chemotherapy and immunomodulatory therapies and by promptly initiating effective antiretroviral medications [ARVs] for treatment of HIV) is critical to favorable outcomes. Since August 2022, consultations with CDC have involved a large proportion of immunocompromised persons, particularly those with HIV and low CD4 cell counts (12). Comprehensive information about each MCM, including mechanism of action, safety, efficacy, and dosing should be reviewed along with the management algorithm when deciding about administration or cessation of MCMs (Table). Interactions with other medications including ARVs should also be considered (17).
Tecovirimat. Tecovirimat is administered two to three times daily (depending upon patient’s weight), typically for 2 weeks. Based on the favorable safety and efficacy profile of tecovirimat compared with other MCMs, if only one MCM is administered, it should be tecovirimat, unless there is a contraindication such as a previous adverse event after receiving the drug. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered tecovirimat taken with a fatty meal compare favorably with those of IV tecovirimat. IV tecovirimat (which is currently available in limited supply) should be prioritized for patients who are unable to take oral medications or fatty meals with each dose, have gastrointestinal disease that might impair absorption (e.g., new or chronic diarrhea), or have diffuse and disseminated infection.†††† For patients for whom IV tecovirimat is indicated, prepositioned oral tecovirimat should be administered until the IV formulation is obtained.
Patients with severe immunocompromise might benefit from extended treatment (i.e., >14 days) if new confirmed OPXV lesions occur or existing lesions worsen despite treatment. Data from animal studies suggest it might be safe to extend tecovirimat treatment (18). Clinicians should carefully consider the risks and benefits of extending treatment, and extensions of short, defined intervals should be used (e.g., an additional 3–7 days) with close monitoring for safety signals and clinical response. Tecovirimat resistance has been detected in a small number of patients with advanced HIV who received tecovirimat for periods of weeks to months (19). Resistance can also develop as the result of subtherapeutic levels of tecovirimat (e.g., because of medication noncompliance or because fatty meals are not taken with the oral formulation). Testing for tecovirimat resistance and pharmacokinetics§§§§ for public health surveillance purposes is encouraged when any new lesions form after ≥7 days of treatment.
Brincidofovir and cidofovir. One of these drugs can be added to tecovirimat treatment for patients with (or at risk for) severe mpox. They are usually administered once weekly for 2 weeks. One animal study suggests that combined treatment (tecovirimat and brincidofovir, the prodrug of cidofovir) might have synergistic efficacy (20). Brincidofovir or cidofovir without tecovirimat should typically only be administered to patients in whom tecovirimat is contraindicated. Brincidofovir and cidofovir should not be used simultaneously or within 1 week of one another, because they form the same active metabolite (cidofovir diphosphate), which has a prolonged duration of action. Both drugs have FDA black box warnings and other safety considerations that require close monitoring. Diarrhea has been commonly reported in patients who receive brincidofovir¶¶¶¶; diarrhea of any etiology might impair absorption of orally administered tecovirimat and indicate a need for IV tecovirimat. In vitro studies suggest that brincidofovir might have superior antiviral activity to that of cidofovir against variola virus, likely because of better cellular uptake (21,22); however, because data are limited, side effect profiles should be prioritized when choosing between the two drugs. Development of resistance to brincidofovir or cidofovir is less likely to occur than is resistance to tecovirimat (23,24).
VIGIV. VIGIV administered as a single dose provides passive immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies against vaccinia virus, which might provide some cross-protection across the OPXV genus, including for MPXV. During the current outbreak, it has been recommended for mpox patients unable to mount a sufficiently robust immune response to clear the virus (e.g., because of HIV-related CD4 count <350 or after solid organ transplantation). Although its effectiveness for mpox is unknown, the safety profile is believed to be favorable; however, caution should be exercised when administering VIGIV to patients with ocular mpox involving the cornea because of a report of an animal study of vaccinia keratitis in which VIGIV was associated with persistent corneal scarring (25,26). VIGIV is available in limited supply. Subsequent dosing (i.e., redosing) decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with CDC. Clinical characteristics and laboratory results that might trigger consideration of additional doses of VIGIV include mpox lesions affecting a large percentage of a patient’s body surface at the time of diagnosis, emergence of new mpox lesions (or expanding borders on existing lesions) several days after VIGIV, persistent severe immunocompromise (e.g., as evidenced by low CD4 values and undetectable OPXV IgM despite attempts to optimize immune function), lesions affecting mobility or that are concerning for long-term sequelae such as sexual dysfunction, and inability to maximally use other MCMs because of adverse events or contraindications.
Trifluridine. Trifluridine is an ophthalmic antiviral drug that has been shown to inhibit replication of several viruses, including vaccinia virus (27) and has demonstrated efficacy against ocular vaccinia virus infections in animal models (25,28) and humans (28,29). Continuous administration beyond the recommended 4-week duration of treatment should be avoided because of the risk for corneal epithelial toxicity (30).

Considerations in the Management of Severe Mpox Cases
Severe mpox (including ocular infections, neurologic complications, myopericarditis, mucosal lesion complications, and uncontrolled viral spread) have been reported. Manifestations of these complications, recommended MCMs, and other clinical considerations for each type of infection (e.g., involvement of specific clinical subspecialists) are summarized (Box).
Ocular infections. These can manifest as blepharitis, conjunctivitis, conjunctival lesions, keratitis, and vision loss. Ocular infections have occurred when MPXV infects the eye or periorbital area, usually via autoinoculation or local spread from nearby lesions (31).
Neurologic complications. Encephalitis and myelitis have been reported in some mpox patients (32). Whether these result from direct viral invasion of the central nervous system or autoimmune disease from antigenic stimulus is not known. Cases involving neurologic complications have rarely been reported to CDC, but have occurred in immunocompetent persons, despite resolving mpox skin lesions.
Myopericarditis. Myopericarditis cases have been reported among immunocompetent patients (1,32,33). The pathogenic mechanism is uncertain but might result from direct viral invasion or lymphocytic infiltration of the myocardium or pericardium, its sequelae (e.g., myonecrosis or myocardial fibrosis), or an autoimmune process.
Complications associated with some mucosal (oral, rectal, genital, and urethral) lesions. Certain mucosal surface lesions can cause strictures and other complications that impair activities of daily living (e.g., reduced oral intake, painful bowel movements, impaired urination, and airway obstruction).
Complications from uncontrolled viral spread in immunocompromised patients. Moderately or severely immunocompromised patients (e.g., advanced HIV and organ transplant recipients) have sometimes developed diffuse and disseminated lesions that have involved multiple organ systems, possibly because of persistent viremia or uncontrolled viral growth (12). Overwhelming systemic illness has resulted in death.
Top
Other Clinical Considerations
Immune dysregulation. Earliest optimization of immune function is critical to favorable outcomes. Mpox patients with advanced HIV who have recently started ARVs and who then experience persistent or progressive lesions might manifest features commonly associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; whether immune dysregulation is the cause of illness or the immune system is unable to effectively clear MPXV from infected cells is not known. Until definitive data are available, administration of systemic immunomodulators (including steroids) to patients with mpox should be undertaken with caution; models suggest that steroids are associated with severe illness and even death in OPXV-infected animals (34).
Lesions that persistently test positive. Positive OPXV and MPXV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results are expected until lesions resolve; therefore, serial testing of lesion specimens is not informative unless new lesions appear or lesions progress despite tecovirimat treatment. Test results do not guide duration of infection control policies because patients are considered infectious until all lesions have scabbed, the scabs have fallen off, and healthy tissue is visible underneath.
Prolonged occurrence of new lesions despite appropriate MCMs. If progressive lesions are noted, particularly after reversal of immunocompromise, diagnostic evaluation should include testing new lesions for OPXV and other infections, and evaluation for superinfections, noninfectious processes such as erythema multiforme, and immunologic function. Laboratories, such as CDC’s poxvirus laboratory,***** can test for presence of viable virus from lesion specimens using culture techniques that might guide patient care. If viral culture is unavailable, evaluating trends in PCR cycle threshold values might be informative.

Knowledge Gaps and Next Steps
Knowledge gaps regarding optimal treatment of severe mpox are best addressed through data collected during randomized controlled trials and other carefully controlled research studies. Patients enrolled in well-designed studies might benefit from the close monitoring provided by these studies (e.g., effective adjustments of tecovirimat doses are made as part of the STOMP trial based on serially monitored pharmacokinetic parameters). Understanding the role of immune dysregulation in the clinical course of severely immunocompromised HIV patients started on ARVs was frequently recognized as a knowledge gap: CDC has partnered with NIH to study this (Virologic and Immunologic Characteristics of Severe Mpox Among Persons with Advanced HIV [VIRISMAP] study).††††† Clinicians and health departments are encouraged to contact CDC when treating mpox in a patient recently started on ARVs. Controlled studies focused on understanding the impact of monotherapy or combination therapy on virus shedding, duration of illness, and clinical outcomes are needed, particularly for patients with severe immunocompromise. Public health laboratories, academic laboratories, and CDC continue to sequence the F13L gene (the tecovirimat target) to assess F13L viral mutations that might be associated with resistance. Phenotypic testing to evaluate resistance is also occurring at CDC.§§§§§ Analysis of anti-OPXV antibody levels and viral neutralization antibody levels are ongoing at CDC and are needed to develop guidance about redosing of VIGIV. Laboratories should consider examining T-cell and humoral responses to mpox in immunocompromised patients because immune response is crucial to viral clearance, and this data might facilitate development of improved clinical guidance (35).
Until data from controlled studies are available, observational data from patients treated under IND might provide insights into clinical outcomes. Providers administering MCMs under IND programs should complete and submit optional data collection forms to facilitate improved understanding of the role of MCMs. CDC will update guidance, as appropriate, as new data emerge.

* Treatment includes MCMs (i.e., tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir, VIGIV, and trifluridine) and supportive therapies, including pain management. https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/pain-management.html
† Most immunocompetent patients should display signs of clinical improvement within 4 days of antiviral initiation (i.e., tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir, and trifluridine). Tecovirimat is expected to reach steady state concentrations by day 6 of dosing in healthy volunteers; therefore, worsening clinical illness after 7 days of treatment in patients with severe illness could prompt additional evaluations.
§ Concern for altered drug absorption includes the inability to tolerate or take oral therapy (e.g., nothing by mouth), or possibility that the oral drug absorption might be altered because of inability to consume a high-fat meal, severity of symptoms (e.g., systemic illness), comorbidities (e.g., history of gastric bypass or underlying GI disease), or other factors that might alter oral drug absorption.
¶ Hemorrhagic disease, a large number of confluent or necrotic lesions, severe lymphadenopathy that is necrotizing or obstructing (e.g., of the upper airway causing airway compromise or of the GI tract necessitating parenteral feeding), edema that is obstructing (e.g., of the lower GI tract), extradermatologic manifestations (e.g., pulmonary nodules, encephalitis, myopericarditis, or ocular infections), and sepsis. Detailed characteristics of severe disease are available at https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/treatment.html#anchor_1655488137245.

¶ Data suggest that an aggressive early dosing regimen for patients with severe immunocompromise might be most beneficial; for this reason, a dose in the higher range (9,000 units/kg) early in the clinical course, potentially followed by an additional dose 3–4 days later, might help saturate viral antigens and halt viremia and viral replication.
** IV administration requires a syringe pump, a device that might not be easily accessible in all health care settings and has a slow infusion longer than 6 hours, irrespective of total infusion volume.
†† Per EA-IND, the standard duration of tecovirimat treatment is 14 days, with clinical data being limited to a 14-day course. Based on individual patient risk-benefit assessment and disease progression, tecovirimat and cidofovir may be extended beyond 14 days, or shortened because of lack of virologic or clinical response or adverse event occurrence. Extension of brincidofovir currently requires FDA authorization on an individual patient basis through an emergency IND request secondary to concerns related to the BBW stated within the table.

† Based on a positive response to the question, “In the past 12 months, have you had an appointment with a doctor, nurse, or other health professional by video or phone?”
§ Health insurance coverage is based on reported status at the time of interview. Private insurance includes plans obtained through an employer, purchased directly, and received through local and community programs. Public coverage includes Medicaid or other state-sponsored health plans among adults without private insurance. In addition to adults without coverage, uninsured includes a very small percentage of adults who only have Indian Health Service coverage or a private plan that paid for only one type of service. Total includes other types of health insurance coverage not shown separately.
¶ Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.

Overall, in 2021, 35.3% of adults aged 18–64 years had a telemedicine visit with a health care professional in the past 12 months. The percentage was higher among women than men overall (41.7% versus 28.8%). Women were also more likely than were men to have had a telemedicine visit among those with private health insurance (44.4% versus 30.5%), Medicaid or other public coverage (42.4% versus 34.3%), and those who were uninsured (19.5% versus 9.8%). Adults with private health insurance (37.5%) or Medicaid or other public coverage (39.3%) were more likely to use telemedicine compared with uninsured adults (14.0%), and this pattern was seen for women and men.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Effectiveness of influenza vaccine varies by season, influenza virus subtype, and antigenic match with circulating viruses.
What is added by this report?
Data from two concurrent studies in Wisconsin found that effectiveness of the 2022–23 influenza vaccine was 54% for preventing medically attended influenza A infection among persons aged <65 years and 71% for preventing symptomatic influenza A illness among children and adolescents aged <18 years.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The 2022–23 influenza vaccine provides substantial protection against circulating influenza A viruses and remains the best way to protect against influenza. Influenza vaccination is recommended as long as influenza viruses are circulating.

In the United States, 2022–23 influenza activity began earlier than usual, increasing in October 2022, and has been associated with high rates of hospitalizations among children* (1). Influenza A(H3N2) represented most influenza viruses detected and subtyped during this period, but A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses cocirculated as well. Most viruses characterized were in the same genetic subclade as and antigenically similar to the viruses included in the 2022–23 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (1,2). Effectiveness of influenza vaccine varies by season, influenza virus subtype, and antigenic match with circulating viruses. This interim report used data from two concurrent studies conducted at Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS) in Wisconsin during October 23, 2022–February 10, 2023, to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Overall, VE was 54% against medically attended outpatient acute respiratory illness (ARI) associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A among patients aged 6 months–64 years. In a community cohort of children and adolescents aged <18 years, VE was 71% against symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza A virus infection. These interim analyses indicate that influenza vaccination substantially reduced the risk for medically attended influenza among persons aged <65 years and for symptomatic influenza in children and adolescents. Annual influenza vaccination is the best strategy for preventing influenza and its complications. CDC recommends that health care providers continue to administer annual influenza vaccine to persons aged ≥6 months as long as influenza viruses are circulating (2).
VE against medically attended influenza was estimated using a test-negative case-control design. Patients aged 6 months–64 years were actively recruited during or after outpatient medical care for ARI (i.e., telehealth, primary care, urgent care, or emergency department), and before or during appointments for clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 at selected MCHS facilities. Patients were eligible if they had a cough of ≤7 days’ duration and had not taken an influenza antiviral medication. Participants completed a brief survey and provided a respiratory specimen for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 testing. Participants who received a positive real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from VE estimation. Participants were considered vaccinated if MCHS health records indicated receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations ≥14 days before illness onset† (2). VE against influenza A viruses and against influenza A(H3N2) viruses was estimated as 100% x (1 − adjusted odds ratio [aOR]). The aOR is the ratio of the odds of vaccination among those who received a positive influenza test result (case-patients) to the odds of vaccination among those who received negative test results for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (control-patients). Estimates were adjusted for age, month of illness onset, and self-reported presence of one or more higher-risk condition§ using logistic regression.
VE against symptomatic influenza in children and adolescents was estimated from an ongoing, prospective, community-cohort study in central Wisconsin (3). Each week, participants (or their guardians) reported the absence or presence of specific symptoms during the previous 7 days. An anterior nasal swab was self- or guardian-collected for research testing when participants reported one or more of the following: fever, cough, loss of smell or taste, sore throat, muscle or body aches, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nasal congestion or runny nose, or nausea or vomiting. Influenza infection was defined as a positive result from research testing or a positive result from clinical testing (results extracted from MCHS health records). Unvaccinated person-time was defined as the time from October 23, 2022 (7 days before occurrence of the first influenza case), until receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine. Vaccinated person-time began ≥14 days after receipt of influenza vaccine (based on health records) according to ACIP recommendations. Person-time for the 13 days after receipt of vaccine was excluded from the analysis. Hazard ratios comparing the rate of influenza A virus infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying influenza vaccination status, age, the presence of one or more higher-risk condition, and COVID-19 vaccination status. VE was estimated as 100% x (1 − adjusted hazard ratio). Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing and genetic characterization of influenza-positive specimens for both studies were performed at MCHS research laboratory. Protocols for both studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at MCHS and were conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶
During December 2, 2022–February 10, 2023, a total of 545 children, adolescents, and adults with medically attended ARI were included in the test-negative design case-control study; 116 (21%) received a positive test result for influenza A virus, and none received a positive test result for influenza B virus. Among 115 (99%) influenza A virus subtypes determined, 29 (25%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 86 (75%) were A(H3N2) viruses (Table 1). All of the 43 characterized viruses were genetically similar to vaccine components; 34 A(H3N2) viruses belonged to subclade 2a.2 and nine A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to subclade 5a.2. The proportion of patients with influenza differed by month of illness onset. Among ARI patients, 186 (34%) had documentation of receipt of 2022–23 influenza vaccine; the percentage vaccinated differed by sex, higher-risk condition, and COVID-19 vaccination status. A large majority of vaccinated participants (84%) received cell culture–based vaccine (ccIIV4). Among the 116 participants who received a positive influenza test result, 26 (22%) received the 2022–23 seasonal influenza vaccine, compared with 160 (37%) of 429 participants who received negative test results for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). The overall adjusted VE against outpatient medically attended ARI associated with influenza A was 54% and 60% against influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
Among 241 community cohort participants aged 1–17 years, 94 (39%) had documented receipt of the 2022–23 influenza vaccine (Table 1); 84% received ccIIV4. Among community cohort participants who received the 2022–23 influenza vaccine, 65% had documentation of receipt of ≥2 COVID-19 vaccine doses. During October 23, 2022–February 10, 2023, 37 (15%) participants received a positive test result for influenza A virus infection; however, three of these occurred ≤14 days after influenza vaccination and were excluded from the study at the time of vaccination. Among the remaining 34 influenza virus infections included in the analysis, 29 were caused by A(H3N2),** one by A(H1N1)pdm09, and four by influenza A viruses with unknown subtype. Six children (18%) with influenza A had received the 2022–23 seasonal influenza vaccine. Among 15,678 unvaccinated person-days, 28 influenza A virus infections occurred (incidence = 1.79 per 1,000 person-days), and among 7,292 vaccinated person-days, six influenza A virus infections occurred (incidence = 0.82 per 1,000 person-days) (Table 2). VE against symptomatic influenza A virus infection was 71%.

Discussion
Influenza activity for the 2022–23 winter season increased earlier than usual, with high rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations among children (2). The interim estimates of 2022–23 influenza VE from two concurrent studies in Wisconsin suggest that the current season’s influenza vaccines are providing substantial protection against influenza. These findings are consistent with estimates reported in the Southern Hemisphere for the 2022 season and Canada for the current season, where similar viruses predominated (4,5). However, influenza vaccination coverage in the United States this season has been lower than during pre–COVID-19 pandemic seasons, particularly among children, pregnant women, and in rural areas (6). Increased vaccination coverage is needed to realize the full potential of seasonal influenza vaccines.
The interim estimates reported reflect early season VE and might differ from end-of-season VE estimates with additional enrollments, or if a change in circulating viruses would occur later in the season. Through the week ending February 4, 2023, influenza activity was low nationally. However, CDC continues to monitor influenza activity through routine surveillance for any indications that activity might increase again; two waves of influenza activity have occurred during many previous seasons (7). Seasonal influenza vaccines protect against influenza A and B viruses, both of which might continue or begin to circulate later in the season, resulting in potentially serious complications.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the studies were restricted to participants from a single geographic area (central Wisconsin). However, viruses that predominated in the study population were similar to those that predominated across the United States (1). Second, older adults aged ≥65 years were excluded from the test-negative study. Age-specific VE estimates against influenza virus infection caused by A(H3N2) viruses are generally lower for older adults (8). Third, sample sizes were small for the interim analysis, which limited the precision of VE estimates, and VE against illness associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections and age-specific estimates could not be determined. Finally, confounding and bias are of concern with observational studies; however, estimates were comparable across two study designs, and the test-negative study design yields valid estimates of influenza VE in most scenarios (9).
Annual influenza vaccination is the best strategy for preventing influenza and its complications. During the 2022–23 season to date, influenza A viruses that predominated are genetically and antigenically similar to current vaccine components. Interim VE estimates from this report indicate that the current season’s influenza vaccine substantially reduces the risk for medical visits among persons aged 6 months–64 years and symptomatic illness associated with influenza A virus infection among children and adolescents aged <18 years. Influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months for as long as influenza viruses are circulating in the community.

* Routine influenza surveillance in the United States indicated that influenza viruses began to circulate and outpatient visits for influenza-like illness were increased above seasonal baseline levels in epidemiologic week 40 (the week ending October 8, 2022).
† Persons aged ≥6 months are recommended to receive annual influenza vaccination. Certain children aged 6 months–8 years need 2 doses of influenza vaccine, depending on influenza vaccination history. Persons aged ≥9 years are recommended to receive 1 dose of influenza vaccine each year, regardless of influenza vaccination history. For the test-negative case-control design analysis, children aged 6 months–8 years were excluded if they needed 2 doses and, at the time of illness, they had received only 1 dose of influenza vaccine ≥14 days earlier, meaning that they were partially vaccinated. For the cohort study, children aged 6 months–8 years were excluded from the study at the time of the first dose if they needed 2 doses and they had received only 1 dose of influenza vaccine.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
During December 6, 2021–June 11, 2022, SARS-CoV-2 testing ≤1 day before departure or proof of recent COVID-19 recovery were required for passengers boarding U.S.-bound flights. Mathematical models have estimated predeparture testing effectiveness in preventing travel-associated transmission.
What is added by this report?
CDC’s Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program collects postarrival nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing from volunteering international air travelers. Among 3,049 pooled (28,056 individual) samples collected during March 20–September 3, 2022, the predeparture testing requirement was associated with 52% lower postarrival SARS-CoV-2 positivity.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Predeparture testing can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk during or after travel by reducing the number of infectious travelers. These results can help guide decisions for future outbreaks.

Beginning December 6, 2021, all international air passengers boarding flights to the United States were required to show either a negative result from a SARS-CoV-2 viral test taken ≤1 day before departure or proof of recovery from COVID-19 within the preceding 90 days (1). As of June 12, 2022, predeparture testing was no longer mandatory but remained recommended by CDC (2,3). Various modeling studies have estimated that predeparture testing the day before or the day of air travel reduces transmission or importation of SARS-CoV-2 by 31%–76% (4–7). Postarrival SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing data from CDC’s Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance program were used to compare SARS-CoV-2 test results among volunteer travelers arriving at four U.S. airports during two 12-week periods: March 20–June 11, 2022, when predeparture testing was required, and June 12–September 3, 2022, when predeparture testing was not required. In a multivariable logistic regression model, pooled nasal swab specimens collected during March 20–June 11 were 52% less likely to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 than were those collected during June 12–September 3, after adjusting for COVID-19 incidence in the flight’s country of origin, sample pool size, and collection airport (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.39–0.58) (p<0.001). These findings support predeparture testing as a tool for reducing travel-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission and provide important real-world evidence that can guide decisions for future outbreaks and pandemics.
The Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program conducts surveillance of travelers at international airports for early detection of new and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and to fill gaps in international surveillance (8). International travelers aged ≥18 years arriving at airports in Newark, New Jersey (Newark Liberty Airport); New York, New York (John F. Kennedy International Airport); Atlanta, Georgia (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport); and San Francisco, California (San Francisco International Airport), who volunteered to participate provided a postarrival lower nasal swab sample in the airport (8). After providing signed consent, participants completed a standardized survey that included questions regarding demographic characteristics, flight country of origin, and whether predeparture testing had occurred and, if so, whether an antigen or molecular test had been performed. In the airport, dry nasal swab samples were pooled (5–25 samples per pool) by the flight country of origin. Pooled samples were sent to a laboratory in the Ginkgo Bioworks laboratory network for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (8).
Postarrival RT-PCR testing results during March 20–June 11, when the predeparture test requirement was in effect, were compared with those during June 12–September 3, when predeparture testing was voluntary. To account for worldwide differences in COVID-19 incidence, pooled test results were matched with daily 7-day average country-level COVID-19 incidence (cases per 100,000 population) from the World Health Organization* based on pool collection date and the flight country of origin. To account for reporting differences by country, normalized incidence was estimated by dividing the 7-day average COVID-19 incidence on the date of pool collection for the flight country of origin by the maximum 7-day average daily incidence for that country during March 20–September 3, then multiplying by 100.
To identify factors associated with positive postarrival SARS-CoV-2 pooled test results, bivariate comparisons and univariable logistic regression were performed. Factors with significant univariable associations (p<0.05) were incorporated into a multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model that included collection airport as a random effect. Alternative periods (during the 4–8 weeks preceding June 12 and those on or after that date) were considered in sensitivity analyses. Analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.2; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
During March 20–September 3, 2022, a total of 28,056 arriving travelers from 24 countries received testing for SARS-CoV-2, yielding 3,049 pooled samples with a median of eight participant samples per pool (range = 5–25). During March 20–June 11, among 16,668 Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance participants, 13,190 (79.1%) reported having had a predeparture test; during June 12–September 3, this percentage declined by 80% to 1,786 of 11,123 (16.1%) participants reporting having had a predeparture test (Figure 1). Among 14,976 participants who reported the type of predeparture test, 10,349 (69.1%) reported receiving an antigen test.
During the analysis period, 691 (22.7%) of 3,049 sample pools tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The percentage of positive pools increased 56% from 17.9% (291 of 1,622) during March 20–June 11, to 28.0% (400 of 1,427) during June 12–September 3 (p<0.001) (Figure 1) (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124584). The increase in the percentage of positive postarrival test results between March 20–June 11 and June 12–September 3 occurred across countries, collection airports, incidences, and pool sizes and was apparent in both bivariate analyses and univariable logistic regression. Participants during each period were similar in age and gender; however, during the period beginning June 12, fewer participants reported U.S. residency (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124585).
Multivariable model results showed that pools of samples collected during March 20–June 11 (when predeparture testing was mandatory) were 52% less likely to be positive than were those when predeparture testing was voluntary (aOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.39–0.58) (p<0.001), after adjusting for COVID-19 incidence in the flight’s country of origin, pool size, and collection airport (Table). COVID-19 incidence in the flight’s country of origin and pool size also remained significant predictors of positive pooled test results in the multivariable model.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted by repeating the regression models using 4- and 8-week periods around June 12 and adjusting for the same covariates. Lower odds of positive test results before June 12 remained significant (4-week periods: aOR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44–0.96 [p<0.001]; 8-week periods: aOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.37–0.63 [p<0.001]) (Figure 2) (Supplementary Table 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124586).

Discussion
Postarrival SARS-CoV-2 test results were 52% less likely to be positive when the predeparture COVID-19 testing requirement was in effect than during the 12-week period after it was discontinued; this finding was true even when controlling for other factors such as incidence in the flight’s country of origin and pool size. These findings, based on observed, real-world traveler data, support the value of predeparture testing as a tool for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with travel and were consistent with estimates from previous modeling studies (4–7).
Sensitivity analyses using shorter time frames around removal of the predeparture testing requirement produced similar findings. Although still statistically significant, the magnitude of this effect decreased when 4-week windows were considered, possibly because of smaller sample sizes during the shorter time frame or higher rates of voluntary predeparture testing during the 4 weeks after the removal of the predeparture test requirement on June 12.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, because participation in the Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program is voluntary, results might not be representative of all international travelers; however, any participation bias was likely consistent across both periods. Second, because of the pooled sampling and testing strategy employed, trends among individual participants could not be assessed. Third, incidence data were matched with pooled test results based on a flight’s country of origin, and it is possible that participants began their itinerary in a different country and later connected to the U.S.-bound flight. Fourth, as testing rates decline globally, reported incidence data might not fully reflect actual COVID-19 risk in a given country (9). Finally, not all travelers during March 20–June 11 had a predeparture test, such as those who recently had COVID-19 (1), and some travelers during June 12–September 3 voluntarily chose to test, potentially diminishing this estimate of the effect of predeparture testing.
Reducing the number of persons traveling while infected with SARS-CoV-2 through predeparture testing could reduce air travel–associated transmission in airports, aircraft, and destination communities. CDC continues to recommend testing before and after international travel (3). Along with other strategies, including isolation of persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and masking, testing before international travel is an important element of a multipronged COVID-19 prevention strategy. In December 2022, results from this analysis were used alongside other evidence to support a predeparture test requirement for travelers boarding flights to the United States from China to slow importation of SARS-CoV-2 during a surge in COVID-19 cases there (10). These findings provide important real-world evidence supporting the effectiveness of predeparture testing that can guide decisions for future outbreaks and pandemics.

As SARS-CoV-2 testing declines worldwide, surveillance of international travelers for SARS-CoV-2 enables detection of emerging variants and fills gaps in global genomic surveillance (1). Because SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces and urine of some infected persons (2), wastewater surveillance in airports and on aircraft has been proposed by the global public health community† as a low-cost mechanism to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants entering the United States. Sampling wastewater directly from aircraft can be used to link SARS-CoV-2 lineage data with flight origin countries without active engagement of travelers (3).
During August 1–September 9, 2022, the biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks, in collaboration with CDC, evaluated the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 variant detection in aircraft wastewater from incoming international flights. Aircraft wastewater samples were collected from selected flights from the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and France arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Wastewater (approximately 0.25 gal [1 L]) was collected from each plane during normal maintenance using a device that attaches to the lavatory service panel port and the lavatory service truck hose.
After concentration with affinity-capture magnetic nanoparticles (4), wastewater samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).§ Samples with cycle thresholds <40 underwent whole genome sequencing using ARTIC (version 4.1; ARTIC Network) primers.¶ Multiple lineages within samples were identified using Freyja, a tool for deconvolution of complex samples.** Sequences meeting quality control criteria (e.g., >70% genome coverage)†† were assigned to sublineages using Pangolin (version 4.1.3)§§ and reported to the airline, public SARS-CoV-2 genomic data repositories, and the CDC National Wastewater Surveillance System. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶
During August 1–September 9, 2022, one sample was collected from each of 88 flights (Figure). Sample collection added approximately 3 minutes to normal aircraft maintenance times. Eighty samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2.*** Overall, 65 samples (81%) were positive; the percentage that were positive was similar among the three flight origin countries sampled (Netherlands: 81% [22 of 27]; France: 81% [22 of 27]; and United Kingdom: 81% [21 of 26]). Twenty-seven SARS-CoV-2 genomes were detected in 25 wastewater samples; sequencing quality control criteria were not met for the remaining 40 positive samples. All identified genomes were Omicron sublineages (United Kingdom: 12 BA.5 and one BA.4.6; France: eight BA.5; and Netherlands: five BA.5 and one BA.2.75). In each of 23 samples, single SARS-CoV-2 genomes were identified and assigned to the BA.5 (21), BA.4.6 (one), and BA.2.75 (one) sublineages. In each of two additional samples, two distinct SARS-CoV-2 genomes were identified and assigned to different BA.5 sublineages (Figure). The SARS-CoV-2 genomes identified in aircraft lavatory wastewater were consistent with Western European sequences uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) at the time (approximately 90% BA.5).†††
This investigation demonstrated the feasibility of aircraft wastewater surveillance as a low-resource approach compared with individual testing to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants without direct traveler involvement or disruption to airport operations. Limitations include dependence on lavatory use during the flight, which correlates with flight duration (5); inability to distinguish travelers with connecting flight itineraries, which lessens precision when ascertaining variant origin; and potential carryover of residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA between flights yielding viral detections unrelated to travelers on the flight. Stringent genome coverage thresholds might reduce the likelihood of carryover variant identification on subsequent flights.
In addition to routinely monitoring variants entering the United States, this modality can be surged based on global public health needs (e.g., outbreaks or mass gatherings in settings with limited SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance). In combination with traveler-based surveillance (1), aircraft wastewater monitoring can provide a complementary early warning system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens of public health concern.

The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron XBB.1.5 variant, a recombinant variant of Omicron BA.2.75 and BA.2.10, was first detected in New York City (NYC) in October 2022. As of January 7, 2023, XBB.1.5 was the predominant variant in NYC, accounting for 81% of sequenced specimens; at that time, only 26% of sequenced specimens nationwide were XBB.1.5 (1). In addition, in December 2022, only 5% of sequenced genomes in the rest of New York were XBB.1.5, suggesting that NYC was likely the epicenter of XBB.1.5’s emergence in the United States (2). The World Health Organization has noted that XBB.1.5 does not carry any mutation known to be associated with a potential change in severity, such as the Delta spike mutation P681R; however, there are currently limited data available about disease severity in human populations (3). Because NYC witnessed the emergence of XBB.1.5 before much of the United States, and the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) routinely links whole genome sequencing and epidemiologic data, DOHMH is uniquely positioned to characterize this subvariant. Although a higher percentage of patients infected with XBB.1.5, compared with those infected with a co-circulating variant, were younger, identified as racial and ethnic minorities, and lived in high-poverty neighborhoods, and a lower percentage had completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series with ≥1 dose of monovalent vaccine booster, there was no evidence of a difference in disease severity.
SARS-CoV-2 specimens collected from NYC residents at five DOHMH COVID-19 Express laboratories, 190 outpatient clinics, and 11 emergency departments across all boroughs within the NYC municipal hospital system were sequenced at DOHMH’s Public Health Laboratory or the Pandemic Response Laboratory, which has operated in Manhattan since September 2020. Sequenced isolates were matched to the DOHMH COVID-19 surveillance database (Maven, version 5.5.1; Consilience Software), Citywide Immunization Registry, health information exchanges, and e-Vitals Death Registry to identify demographic characteristics and previous SARS-CoV-2–positive test results, monovalent immunization history,* hospitalization status, and vital status, respectively. Persons infected with XBB.1.5 (3,019) were compared with persons infected with BQ.1† (6,067) during November 1, 2022–January 4, 2023, because both variants were co-circulating in NYC starting in November 2022, and BQ.1 was the predominant variant in NYC when XBB.1.5 emerged. Comparisons across categorical characteristics were made using Pearson chi-square or Fisher’s exact test; continuous variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (SAS Enterprise Guide; version 7.1; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by the NYC DOHMH Institutional Review Board and was determined to be public health surveillance and therefore not subject to human subjects review.
During November–December 2022, the percentage of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates in NYC identified as XBB.1.5 increased eightfold, from 8% to 72%. Compared with patients infected with BQ.1 (p<0.001), those with XBB.1.5 infections tended to be younger (median age = 41 years [XBB.1.5] versus 44 years [BQ.1]), Hispanic or Latino or non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (68.1% versus 61.5%), and residents of the Bronx, Brooklyn, or Queens (82.6% versus 76.1%); a higher percentage lived in high- or very high–poverty neighborhoods (43.2% versus 41.9%) (Table). The percentage who had received a primary COVID-19 vaccination series and ≥1 dose of monovalent vaccine booster was lower among patients with XBB.1.5 infections (41.1%) than among those with BQ.1 infections (46.0%). The percentages of XBB.1.5 and BQ.1 patients whose specimen was collected ≥90 days after a previous collection of a specimen with a SARS-CoV-2–positive test result, which could suggest possible reinfection, were similar (25.2% [XBB.1.5]; 25.4% [BQ.1]). No difference in the proportion of patients hospitalized or those who died was observed, suggesting no significant difference in disease severity.
Limitations of these data are that patients with sequencing results accounted for 4%–12% of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases diagnosed in NYC in November and December 2022 (4); therefore, characteristics of persons with and without sequencing results might differ. Although a higher percentage of patients with sequencing results, compared with those without sequencing results, were aged 18–64 years (74% versus 68%), resided in high- or very high–poverty neighborhoods (42% versus 37%) and in Brooklyn (35% versus 29%), identified as Black (28% versus 20%), and had a COVID-19 hospitalization (7% versus 6%), the percentage with COVID-19 deaths was the same (1%) among all patients with laboratory-confirmed cases, irrespective of sequencing status.
XBB.1.5 emerged rapidly in NYC during November–December 2022 and earlier than in the rest of the United States. Preliminary findings from a sample of sequenced isolates in NYC do not suggest more severe disease among patients infected with XBB.1.5 compared with patients infected with BQ.1; however, these findings might change as more data on these outcomes accumulate. Although a small proportion of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in NYC are sequenced, linked epidemiologic and genomic data provide a means to evaluate characteristics of emerging variants, including disease severity, that are important for rapid risk assessment (3). Routine linkage of epidemiologic and sequencing data allows tracking of emerging variants and ongoing assessment of reinfection, infection after vaccination, and disease severity.

† Serious psychological distress is based on responses to six questions, “During the past 30 days, how often did you feel 1) so sad that nothing could cheer you up, 2) nervous, 3) restless or fidgety, 4) hopeless, 5) that everything was an effort, or 6) worthless?” The response options “none of the time,” “a little of the time,” “some of the time,” “most of the time,” and “all of the time” were each scored from 0–4 points, respectively, and then summed for a total score ranging from 0–24 points. A value of ≥13 was used to define serious psychological distress. Only respondents who answered all six questions were included in the analysis.
§ Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.
Top
In 2021, 3.7% of adults aged ≥18 years had serious psychological distress in the past 30 days with percentages higher among women (4.6%) than among men (2.7%). The higher percentages among women were seen across all age groups: 5.6% versus 3.1% in adults aged 18–44 years, 4.5% versus 2.8% in those aged 45–64 years, and 2.8% versus 1.7% in those aged ≥65 years. The percentage of women who had serious psychological distress in the past 30 days decreased with age; the percentage of men who had serious psychological distress in the past 30 days was higher among those aged 18–44 and 45–64 years than among those aged ≥65 years.

Table 2
Good nutrition in early childhood supports optimal growth, development, and health (1). Federal guidelines support a dietary pattern with daily fruit and vegetable consumption and limited added sugars, including limited consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (1). Government-published dietary intake estimates for young children are outdated at the national level and unavailable at the state level. CDC analyzed data from the 2021 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH)* to describe how frequently, according to parent report, children aged 1–5 years (18,386) consumed fruits, vegetables, and sugar-sweetened beverages, nationally and by state. During the preceding week, approximately one in three (32.1%) children did not eat a daily fruit, nearly one half (49.1%) did not eat a daily vegetable, and more than one half (57.1%) drank a sugar-sweetened beverage at least once. Estimates of consumption varied by state. In 20 states, more than one half of children did not eat a vegetable daily during the preceding week. In Vermont, 30.4% of children did not eat a daily vegetable during the preceding week, compared with 64.3% in Louisiana. In 40 states and the District of Columbia, more than one half of children drank a sugar-sweetened beverage at least once during the preceding week. The percentage of children drinking sugar-sweetened beverages at least once during the preceding week ranged from 38.6% in Maine to 79.3% in Mississippi. Many young children are not consuming fruits and vegetables daily and are regularly consuming sugar-sweetened beverages. Federal nutrition programs and state policies and programs can support improvements in diet quality by increasing access to and availability of fruits and vegetables and healthy beverages in places where young children live, learn, and play.
NSCH uses paper- and web-based questionnaires to collect information on the health and well-being of U.S. children and adolescents aged <18 years; it is funded and directed by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Maternal Child Health Bureau and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Households are randomly sampled from the Census Bureau’s Master Address File and contacted via mail to identify those with at least one child or adolescent aged <18 years. One child or adolescent per household is selected, and an age-specific questionnaire is completed by a household adult familiar with the selected child or adolescent’s health and health care. Children aged <6 years are oversampled. The surveys were available in English and Spanish. The 2021 weighted overall response and interview completion rates† were 40.3% and 79.5%, respectively. Data were collected during June 2021–January 2022.
Respondents were asked three questions about children aged 1–5 years regarding the frequency of consuming fruits,§ vegetables,¶ and sugar-sweetened beverages** during the preceding week. Response options included the following: did not consume item, 1–3 times in the preceding week, 4–6 times in the preceding week, 1 time per day, 2 times per day, and ≥3 times per day. Categories were recoded to provide an estimate of daily (≥1 time per day in preceding week) or less than daily (<1 time per day in preceding week) consumption of fruit and vegetables. Categories of sugar-sweetened beverages were dichotomized to indicate consumption at least once or no consumption during the preceding week. Among the 18,830 children aged 1–5 years, 444 (2.4%) were missing data on at least one item and were excluded, leaving a final analytic sample of 18,386. Weighted percentages are presented overall, by child’s age, race and ethnicity, household food sufficiency,†† and by state, using SPSS Complex Samples (version 1.0.0.1401; IBM) to account for the sampling procedures. Pearson Chi-square tests of independence were used to identify differences within each outcome by sociodemographic characteristics. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§
In 2021, 32.1% of children aged 1–5 years did not eat a daily fruit, and 49.1% did not eat a daily vegetable during the preceding week; 57.1% drank a sugar-sweetened beverage at least once during the preceding week (Table 1). Daily consumption of fruit and vegetables and weekly consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages differed by age, race and ethnicity, and household food sufficiency. Children aged 1 year were more likely than were older children to eat either a daily fruit or a daily vegetable during the preceding week and were less likely to drink a sugar-sweetened beverage (chi-square p<0.05). The percentage of children who did not eat a daily fruit or vegetable was highest among non-Hispanic Black (Black) children and lowest among non-Hispanic White (White) children. Drinking a sugar-sweetened beverage at least once during the preceding week ranged from 47.5% among multiracial non-Hispanic children to 71.7% among Black children. Compared with children living in food-sufficient households, those living in households with marginal or low food sufficiency were less likely to eat either a daily fruit or vegetable and were more likely to consume sugar-sweetened beverages during the preceding week.
Estimates of intake varied by state (Table 2). The percentage of children who did not eat fruit daily during the preceding week ranged from 16.3% in Vermont to 49.9% in Louisiana. Vegetable intake also varied: 30.4% of children in Vermont did not eat a daily vegetable, compared with 64.3% in Louisiana. The percentage of children who consumed a sugar-sweetened beverage at least once during the preceding week ranged from 38.8% (Maine) to 79.3% (Mississippi). In 20 states, more than one half of children did not eat a daily vegetable during the preceding week (Figure). In 40 states and the District of Columbia, more than one half of children drank a sugar-sweetened beverage at least once during the preceding week.

Discussion
In 2021, nearly one third (32.1%) of children aged 1–5 years did not eat a daily fruit, and nearly one half (49.1%) did not eat a daily vegetable during the preceding week; more than one half (57.1%) drank a sugar-sweetened beverage at least once during the preceding week. The percentage of children who did not eat a daily fruit or vegetable was higher among those who were aged 2–5 years, Black, or lived in households with limited food sufficiency. Similar patterns were seen for consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. State-level estimates for all three dietary practices varied widely.
Young children need specific nutrients to support their optimal growth and development (1,2). A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help provide these nutrients (1). Limiting or reducing foods and beverages higher in added sugars, including sugar-sweetened beverages, is important because added sugars are associated with increased risk of obesity, dental caries, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (3–6). These data provide current assessments that states can use to prioritize actions to improve early childhood nutrition.
Programs and policies can support efforts to improve fruit and vegetable intake and reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among young children. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), a program for low-income families, provides nutrition education, supplemental foods, including fruits and vegetables, and referrals to health care services.¶¶ WIC is an important conduit for reaching participating families with nutrition education messages and healthy supplemental foods. Nutrition standards in early care and education (ECE) systems and in the charitable food system can support access to fruits and vegetables and help limit the intake of foods and beverages with added sugars. CDC supports*** system-level efforts, including standards in the ECE state licensing regulations that support healthy eating, professional development opportunities for ECE staff members, and programs that provide young children an opportunity to learn about food, agriculture, and gardening through hands-on experiences. Federally funded programs, such as produce voucher programs and the Child and Adult Care Food Program, have resulted in serving more nutritious foods to children (7). Federal nutrition programs are a system-level approach that can improve diet quality for young children. The effectiveness of federal, state, or local-level programs could be enhanced by education emphasizing the importance of daily fruit and vegetable consumption and reducing sugar-sweetened beverage intake across multiple settings. Examples of existing programs that support such educational efforts include home visiting programs,††† Healthy Start,§§§ and USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education.¶¶¶ Health care providers can also convey the importance of healthy dietary choices through anticipatory guidance (i.e., Bright Futures****) and regular screening and counseling on food and nutrition security and key dietary behaviors during health care encounters. Understanding how access, affordability, and taste preferences influence diet for young children (8,9) could help tailor programmatic, communication, and education efforts.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, children’s dietary intake was reported by an adult who might not know everything a child ate. Second, frequency of intake was assessed, not the amount consumed; therefore, intake cannot be tied to a dietary recommendation. Third, information collection occurred in English or Spanish and might not represent families who speak other languages. Finally, questions reflect intake during the preceding week and might not represent usual intake.
With renewed national focus on nutrition, hunger, and health and the call to improve food and nutrition security,†††† these data provide information for decision makers and practitioners to ensure that young children have an opportunity for their healthiest start. Collectively, programs and policies aimed at supporting nutrition for young children could lead to improvements in dietary quality and support optimal growth and health.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
An estimated 11–21 million typhoid fever cases and 148,000–161,000 associated deaths occurred in 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends safe, effective typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV) for typhoid fever control.
What is added by this report?
Population-based and modeling studies confirm high typhoid incidence in the WHO South-East Asian, Eastern Mediterranean, and African regions. Since 2018, five countries have introduced TCV into their national routine immunization schedule.
What are the implications for public health practice?
To guide evidence-based TCV introduction decisions, countries with endemic typhoid should consider all available information, including surveillance of laboratory-confirmed cases, population-based and modeling studies, and outbreak reports. Establishing and strengthening typhoid fever surveillance will be important to measure vaccine impact.

Typhoid fever, an acute febrile illness caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), is endemic in many low- and middle-income countries† (1). In 2015, an estimated 11–21 million typhoid fever cases and 148,000–161,000 associated deaths occurred worldwide (2). Effective prevention strategies include improved access to and use of infrastructure supporting safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); health education; and vaccination (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends programmatic use of typhoid conjugate vaccines for typhoid fever control and prioritization of vaccine introduction in countries with the highest typhoid fever incidence or high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi (1). This report describes typhoid fever surveillance, incidence estimates, and the status of typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction during 2018–2022. Because routine surveillance for typhoid fever has low sensitivity, population-based studies have guided estimates of case counts and incidence in 10 countries since 2016 (3–6). In 2019, an updated modeling study estimated that 9.2 million (95% CI = 5.9–14.1) typhoid fever cases and 110,000 (95% CI = 53,000–191,000) deaths occurred worldwide, with the highest estimated incidence in the WHO South-East Asian (306 cases per 100,000 persons), Eastern Mediterranean (187), and African (111) regions (7). Since 2018, five countries (Liberia, Nepal, Pakistan, Samoa [based on self-assessment], and Zimbabwe) with estimated high typhoid fever incidence (≥100 cases per 100,000 population per year) (8), high antimicrobial resistance prevalence, or recent outbreaks introduced typhoid conjugate vaccines into their routine immunization programs (2). To guide vaccine introduction decisions, countries should consider all available information, including surveillance of laboratory-confirmed cases, population-based and modeling studies, and outbreak reports. Establishing and strengthening typhoid fever surveillance will be important to measure vaccine impact.

Surveillance and Estimates of Disease Incidence and Antimicrobial Resistance Prevalence
WHO recommends that countries with endemic typhoid fever§ establish health facility–based surveillance with laboratory confirmation to determine disease burden,¶ monitor antimicrobial resistance patterns, facilitate rapid outbreak detection, and assess vaccine impact (3). Because the clinical presentation of typhoid fever is often indistinguishable from that of other acute febrile illnesses common in areas with endemic typhoid (e.g., malaria and dengue), diagnosis is dependent upon laboratory confirmation, typically blood culture (3). However, blood culture has a low sensitivity (40%–60%), which is further reduced by widespread use of prediagnosis antibiotic use, has limited availability at health care facilities, and is not systematically obtained from febrile patients (1–3). Therefore, the number of laboratory-confirmed S. Typhi cases represents a small proportion of the actual disease incidence. Countries report data on selected vaccine-preventable diseases to WHO and UNICEF annually using the electronic Joint Reporting Form (eJRF). During 2018–2021, 59–62 countries reported laboratory-confirmed typhoid fever through eJRF.** Reported cases increased from approximately 8,800 in 2018, when typhoid fever surveillance was first added to eJRF, to 1 million in 2021.
Because of the low sensitivity of typhoid fever surveillance, specially designed population-based studies have been implemented to estimate disease incidence. Since 2016, typhoid fever incidence has been estimated in specific countries through three surveillance projects: 1) the Strategic Typhoid Alliance across Africa and Asia (for Bangladesh, Malawi, and Nepal); 2) the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (for Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan); and 3) the Severe Typhoid in Africa program (for Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, and Nigeria) (Table 1) (4–6). Modeling data from the Global Burden of Disease study estimated that 9.2 million (95% CI = 5.9–14.1) typhoid fever cases and 110,000 (95% CI = 53,000–191,000) associated deaths occurred worldwide in 2019 (7). The highest estimated 2019 incidence, by region, occurred in the WHO South-East Asian (306 cases per 100,000 persons), Eastern Mediterranean (187), and African (111) regions (Table 1) (Figure) and, by age group, occurred in children aged 5–9 years, followed by children and adolescents aged 10–14 years and children aged 1–4 years, respectively.††
An additional indication of typhoid fever burden can be obtained through analysis of outbreak§§ data. During 2017–2022, seven confirmed typhoid fever outbreaks were identified from ongoing outbreak monitoring activities by CDC’s Global Disease Detection Operation Center,¶¶ including the Philippines (2022: 14,056 cases) and three in Zimbabwe (January–March 2017: 1,312 cases; November 2017–February 2018: 3,187 cases; and August–December 2018: 7,134 cases), as well as outbreaks with confirmed antimicrobial-resistant cases in Pakistan (January 2018–December 2019: 14,894 cases) and China (2022: 23 cases) (9).
Apart from high disease incidence, the need for action is enhanced by the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in many countries with endemic typhoid fever. During 2010–2018, approximately 35% of reported S. Typhi isolates in Asia and 75% of those in Africa were resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (defined as multidrug resistant [MDR]) (10). After a typhoid outbreak in Hyderabad, Pakistan in 2016, Pakistan became the first country to report MDR strains with additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins (defined as extensively drug resistant [XDR]); Pakistan continues to report high proportions of XDR S. Typhi cases (2). Resistance to an increasing number of antimicrobials, including fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, and azithromycin (a macrolide), has been documented in Asia (10).

Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine Introduction
WHO has prequalified two typhoid conjugate vaccines: Typbar-TCV (Bharat Biotech International Limited) and TYPHIBEV (Biological E. Limited)*** (2). Typhoid conjugate vaccines may be administered to persons aged ≥6 months, which facilitates their inclusion in routine immunization programs (2). A single dose administered to children has been shown to be safe and 79%–95% effective, with an antibody response persisting up to 7 years (2). Co-administration of typhoid conjugate vaccine with routinely administered vaccines (e.g., measles-containing vaccines, yellow fever vaccine, and serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccines) does not interfere with the immune response to typhoid conjugate vaccines or to the other simultaneously administered vaccines. Use of typhoid conjugate vaccine has been shown to be cost-effective for countries with high to very high typhoid fever incidence (1,2).
Since 2018, WHO has recommended that typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction be prioritized in countries with the highest typhoid fever incidence or a high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi. Vaccine introduction should be implemented in combination with health education, WASH improvements, and health care worker training on typhoid fever diagnosis and treatment (1). The first public health introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccine occurred in 2018 in Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, India, as part of a program evaluation activity (2). Subsequently, typhoid conjugate vaccine has been introduced nationally into the routine immunization schedule for children at either age 9 months or 15–18 months in Pakistan (2019 Phase 1, 2021 Phase 2, and 2022 Phase 3), Liberia (2021), Zimbabwe (2021), Nepal (2022), and Samoa (2021 Phase 1 and 2022 Phase 2) (4) (Figure) (Table 2). Introduction in Malawi is planned for 2023.
Catch-up vaccination campaigns targeting children aged 6 months–14 years are recommended at the time of introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines into the routine immunization schedule, when feasible and supported by epidemiologic data, to maximize vaccination impact (1). Overall, more than 75 million children have received typhoid conjugate vaccines during catch-up campaigns, with post-campaign coverage estimates ranging from 63% to 95% (2). Nepal, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe conducted integrated campaigns that included other routine vaccines or identification of unvaccinated and undervaccinated children (2). Typhoid conjugate vaccine has also been used in outbreak response in Pakistan and Zimbabwe (2).

Discussion
Since WHO recommended the use of typhoid conjugate vaccine to prevent typhoid fever in countries with endemic disease in 2018, only five countries, including three (7%) of the 44 countries and freely associated states with estimated high typhoid fever incidence based on Global Burden of Disease study estimates,††† have introduced typhoid conjugate vaccines into their routine immunization schedule. Probable factors leading to delayed vaccine introduction include the presence of competing health priorities, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, and insufficient disease burden data to guide national vaccine introduction decisions. Typhoid fever surveillance data are frequently limited to clinically suspected cases and serologic diagnostic tests with poor specificity. Population-based incidence studies are costly, time-consuming, technically challenging, and not available in most countries. Data on the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant strains of S. Typhi are important for typhoid vaccine introduction decisions, but such data are lacking because of limited typhoid surveillance. Since 2018, additional data on the safety and effectiveness of typhoid conjugate vaccine and the lack of interference with other co-administered routine vaccines have become available and support the WHO typhoid vaccine introduction recommendation (2). Insufficient data from surveillance or population-based studies should not preclude considering typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction. Countries with endemic typhoid fever are encouraged to review regional and neighboring countries’ data, as well as national data sources such as published population-based studies, modeling data, laboratory-confirmed cases, antimicrobial testing studies, outbreak reports, and case reports of intestinal perforation (a hallmark of severe typhoid fever) to guide assessments of typhoid fever disease burden, and vaccine introduction decisions.
The five countries that have introduced typhoid conjugate vaccine have shared lessons learned regarding introduction strategies and integrated campaign opportunities. Among these five countries, Nepal, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe conducted integrated campaigns, including the simultaneous administration of other routine vaccines, vitamin A supplementation, hygiene promotion, or identification of undervaccinated children (2). Given the wide recommended age range for typhoid conjugate vaccine catch-up campaigns (6 months–14 years), school-based vaccination was found to be a useful strategy in Nepal, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe. However, drawbacks to such campaigns included difficulty reaching out-of-school children and increased absences on vaccination days, which schools ascribed to vaccine hesitancy stemming from misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic (2). Further country engagement is needed to better understand and address barriers to vaccination. Notably, four of the five countries that have introduced typhoid conjugate vaccine benefited from financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi).§§§ Among the 44 countries considered to have high typhoid fever incidence, 11 middle-income countries are ineligible for Gavi support and might face financial barriers to typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction.
WHO recommends that countries with endemic typhoid fever establish and strengthen health care facility–based surveillance with laboratory confirmation, either through passive or active reporting to monitor disease trends and measure vaccine impact (3). Sentinel site surveillance has been critical for monitoring vaccine impact and disease trends for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Expanding blood culture diagnostic capacity strengthens surveillance for other invasive bacterial pathogens as well as typhoid fever and is integral to S. Typhi antimicrobial resistant strain surveillance. In addition, the development and validation of improved diagnostic tests and environmental surveillance might expand or augment typhoid surveillance in the future (2,3). In areas with endemic typhoid fever, nontraumatic intestinal perforation cases should be considered probable cases of typhoid or paratyphoid fever and have been used to identify outbreaks (3). Countries are encouraged to report laboratory-confirmed typhoid fever case data through eJRF to facilitate the monitoring of global typhoid fever incidence.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data for both annual cases and outbreaks are underreported because of limited laboratory capacity. Second, the identification of typhoid fever outbreaks often relies on potentially incomplete reports from media, governments, or in-country technical partners including CDC and WHO; thus, outbreaks are likely underreported. Finally, recent programmatic experience with typhoid conjugate vaccine is still limited and accruing; therefore, data on routine typhoid conjugate vaccine coverage and its impact on disease are not yet available.
Use of typhoid conjugate vaccine in immunization programs is part of the multisectoral typhoid fever prevention approach, including WASH improvement and strengthened national surveillance, and will help countries reduce typhoid fever morbidity and mortality. Countries’ experiences with successful typhoid conjugate vaccine introductions and catch-up campaigns that included integrated health interventions could serve as examples for other countries planning to introduce typhoid conjugate vaccine. Sustained financial and technical commitment are needed at the national and international levels for improving WASH implementation, compiling national typhoid fever disease prevalence data, and increasing typhoid conjugate vaccination coverage to further advance typhoid fever control.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Since June 2022, COVID-19 primary series vaccination has been recommended for young children with either Moderna for children aged 6 months–5 years or Pfizer-BioNTech for children aged 6 months–4 years; however, postauthorization vaccine effectiveness data are limited.
What is added by this report?
Complete monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech primary series vaccination provides protection for children aged 3–5 and 3–4 years, respectively, against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least the first 4 months after vaccination.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Children should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, including completing the primary series; those who are eligible should receive a bivalent vaccine dose. Continued vaccine effectiveness monitoring in young children is needed.

On June 18, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for use of the 2-dose monovalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine as a primary series for children aged 6 months–5 years* and the 3-dose monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as a primary series for children aged 6 months–4 years,† based on safety, immunobridging, and limited efficacy data from clinical trials (1–3). Monovalent mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated using the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) program, which provides SARS-CoV-2 testing to persons aged ≥3 years at pharmacy and community-based testing sites nationwide§ (4,5). Among children aged 3–5 years with one or more COVID-19–like illness symptoms¶ for whom a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) was performed during August 1, 2022–February 5, 2023, VE of 2 monovalent Moderna doses (complete primary series) against symptomatic infection was 60% (95% CI = 49% to 68%) 2 weeks–2 months after receipt of the second dose and 36% (95% CI = 15% to 52%) 3–4 months after receipt of the second dose. Among symptomatic children aged 3–4 years with NAATs performed during September 19, 2022–February 5, 2023, VE of 3 monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech doses (complete primary series) against symptomatic infection was 31% (95% CI = 7% to 49%) 2 weeks–4 months after receipt of the third dose; statistical power was not sufficient to estimate VE stratified by time since receipt of the third dose. Complete monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech primary series vaccination provides protection for children aged 3–5 and 3–4 years, respectively, against symptomatic infection for at least the first 4 months after vaccination. CDC expanded recommendations for use of updated bivalent vaccines to children aged ≥6 months on December 9, 2022 (6), which might provide increased protection against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (7,8). Children should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including completing the primary series; those who are eligible should receive a bivalent vaccine dose.
ICATT is a CDC program** that contracts with pharmacy- and community-based testing vendors to provide no-cost SARS-CoV-2 testing nationwide (4,5). At registration, caregivers of minors report information on the presence of COVID-19–like illness symptoms, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection,†† underlying health conditions,§§ and COVID-19 vaccination status. Caregivers are asked to report total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, the manufacturer of each dose, and the month and year of receipt of the most recent dose.¶¶ Testing vendors report SARS-CoV-2 test data directly to CDC, including collection date and result.
NAATs from children with one or more COVID-19–like illness symptom were eligible for inclusion in the test-negative design case-control study. Tests from children were excluded if the caregiver reported any of the following conditions: immunocompromise, positive SARS-CoV-2 test within 3 months, receipt of a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or mixed product regimen,*** COVID-19 vaccine dose receipt within 2 weeks of test date,††† or third COVID-19 vaccine dose received during or after December 2022 (when bivalent vaccines were recommended for this age group).§§§ Data included NAATs performed among children aged 3–5 years (Moderna analysis) and aged 3–4 years (Pfizer-BioNTech analysis).¶¶¶ VE, stratified by vaccine product and dose number, was estimated by comparing odds of COVID-19 vaccination versus being unvaccinated in case-patients (those who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result) and control-patients (those who received a negative test result). VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted odds ratio) x 100.**** Analysis periods varied for each product and dose combination. Children became eligible to be included in each analysis 2 weeks after the initial date a child could have received each product and dose combination, affecting comparability of product-specific estimates.†††† VE for a partial series (1 dose of Moderna; 1 or 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech) was assessed from 2 weeks after receipt of the most recent dose through the recommended interval to the next dose.§§§§ Consistent with previous studies (7,8), VE estimates with 95% CI width >50 percentage points were considered imprecise and not reported. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶¶
Among NAATs performed through ICATT during July 4–February 5, 2023, among children with one or more COVID-19–like illness symptom (before applying exclusion criteria), 18%, 17%, and 26% of those aged 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, had received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose.***** After applying exclusion criteria, 37,010 NAATs performed at 8,741 ICATT testing sites for children aged 3–5 years were included in the Moderna VE analysis, and 24,094 NAATs performed at 7,615 ICATT testing sites for children aged 3–4 years were included in the Pfizer-BioNTech VE analysis. In the Moderna analysis, 26%, 39% and 35% of children were aged 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively; in the Pfizer-BioNTech analysis, 40% and 60% of children were aged 3 and 4 years, respectively (Table 1). VE of one monovalent Moderna dose (partial primary series) was 40% at 2 weeks–1 month after dose 1 (Table 2). VE of two monovalent Moderna doses (complete primary series) was 60% at 2 weeks–2 months after dose 2 and 36% at 3–4 months. VE of one monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech dose (partial primary series) was 19% at 2 weeks–1 month after dose 1. VE of 2 monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech doses (partial primary series) was 40% at 2 weeks–3 months after dose 2, reflecting the interval between doses 2 and 3. VE of three monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech doses (complete primary series) was 31% at 2 weeks–4 months after dose 3; statistical power was not sufficient to estimate VE stratified by time since dose 3.

Discussion
Postauthorization estimates of COVID-19 VE against symptomatic infection in young children indicate that complete primary series vaccination with either monovalent Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech provides protection for children aged 3–5 and 3–4 years, respectively, against symptomatic infection for at least the first 4 months after vaccination. The goal of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program is to prevent severe disease and hospitalization (9); however, postauthorization VE against symptomatic infection provides important insight into vaccine protection, as estimates of VE against severe disease in this age group are not yet available. Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines has generally been higher against more severe outcomes than for symptomatic infection (10). Vaccination is an important tool for protecting children from COVID-19. Children should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including completing the primary series; those who are eligible should receive a bivalent vaccine dose.
In this analysis, 1 dose of monovalent Moderna vaccine provided detectable protection against symptomatic infection in children aged 3–5 years; however, the point estimate only reflects the short period from 2 weeks after dose 1 to receipt of dose 2 (in the 2 weeks–1 month after the dose). Significant protection was not observed in the 2 weeks–1 month period after a single monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose. However, 2 Pfizer-BioNTech doses (which is an incomplete primary series for this age group) provided detectable protection against symptomatic infection, indicating that children who are awaiting their third dose had protection against symptomatic infection, but this VE is only reflective of protection provided during the interval between dose 2 and 3. In the Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial, the prespecified immunobridging criteria were met after dose 3 but not after dose 2 among children aged 2–5 years (3). Receipt of a complete COVID-19 vaccination primary series is important to optimize vaccine-conferred protection in young children (1,6).
Several studies have demonstrated that monovalent mRNA VE wanes among older children and adults, particularly during Omicron variant predominance (4,5). The current analysis suggests that waning of complete monovalent Moderna primary series VE against symptomatic infection might occur among children aged 3–5 years by 3–4 months after the second dose based on point estimates (although CIs overlapped), similar to patterns seen in older children and adults in the first months after vaccination. Waning of monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech VE could not be assessed but is also likely based on analyses in older children and adults (4,5). Bivalent vaccines were introduced to address reduced VE against Omicron variants and waning protection (9). As of December 9, 2022, children aged 6 months–4 years receiving a Pfizer-BioNTech primary series are recommended to receive a monovalent vaccine for doses 1 and 2 and a bivalent vaccine as dose 3, and children aged 6 months–5 years who received the 2-dose Moderna primary series are recommended to receive a bivalent booster dose ≥2 months after completion of the primary series (6). Bivalent vaccines provide additional protection against infection and hospitalization in adults who have previously received monovalent COVID-19 vaccines (7,8); benefits in children are expected to be similar.
The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, VE estimates for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech are not directly comparable because of different dates of eligibility for completion of the primary series, which might affect product-specific VE estimates. Decreased SARS-CoV-2 circulation during September 19, 2022–February 5, 2023 (when VE for a complete primary series for both products could be assessed), compared with that during August 1–September 18, 2022††††† (when only Moderna complete primary series VE could be assessed) limited statistical power to estimate potential waning of 3-dose Pfizer-BioNTech VE. Second, vaccination coverage in this analysis is low, albeit higher than among children aged 2–4 years in the United States overall.§§§§§ Vaccinated children might be systematically different from unvaccinated children in COVID-19 risk or likelihood of seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing, which could bias VE results; thus, these early VE estimates should be considered preliminary. Third, data on hospitalization or severe outcomes are not available in ICATT. Fourth, vaccination status was reported by caregivers and was not verified, which could have resulted in misclassification of vaccination history. Fifth, this analysis reflects VE in children with a high prevalence of previous infection. By November–December 2022, start highlight87%end highlight of U.S. children aged 6 months–4 years had evidence of infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 immunity¶¶¶¶¶; however, caregivers reported previous SARS-CoV-2 infection >3 months earlier for only approximately 20% of children in this analysis, and, therefore, the analysis was not adjusted for previous infection. Consequently, vaccine effectiveness in this analysis reflects the current situation among young children in the United States. Sixth, data were not collected on behaviors affecting COVID-19 risk (e.g., child care attendance), which could result in residual confounding. Finally, these VE estimates reflect circulation of a mix of Omicron sublineages.******
Complete monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech primary series vaccination provided protection against symptomatic infection in children aged 3–5 and 3–4 years, respectively, for at least the first 4 months after vaccination. CDC will continue to monitor VE in young children. All children should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including completing the primary series; those who are eligible should receive a bivalent vaccine dose.

* Moderna COVID-19 vaccine primary series consists of two 25 μg doses separated by at least 4–8 weeks.
† Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine primary series consists of three 3 μg doses, with at least 3–8 weeks between doses 1 and 2 and ≥8 weeks between doses 2 and 3.
§ At nearly all ICATT sites, test eligibility is restricted to persons aged ≥3 years. Therefore, this analysis was limited to children aged ≥3 years.
¶ At test registration, caregivers reported the presence of any of the following COVID-19–like illness symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath, recent loss of sense of smell or taste, muscle pain, fatigue, chills, headache, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, vomiting, or diarrhea, which were reported to CDC as asymptomatic or symptomatic with one or more symptom.
** https://www.cdc.gov/icatt/index.html (Accessed February 10, 2023).
†† During the analytic period, different versions of the questionnaire were used. Persons who reported a history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were also asked to report when the previous positive test result occurred and to select all applicable options. One version asked if the previous SARS-CoV-2 positive test result was within 90 days or ≥90 days ago, and another version asked if the previous positive test result was within the last week, between 1 week and 3 months ago, or >3 months ago.
§§ The following underlying conditions were included on the questionnaire: heart conditions, high blood pressure, overweight or obesity, diabetes, current or former smoker, kidney failure or end stage renal disease, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate to severe asthma, cystic fibrosis, or pulmonary embolism), and immunocompromising conditions. For immunocompromising conditions, the following examples were provided on the questionnaire: immunocompromising medications, solid organ or blood stem cell transplant, HIV, or other immunocompromising conditions.
¶¶ Only month and year of receipt were reported for the vaccine dose from some participating pharmacies, and some questionnaires included the month and year of each dose, and others included the month and year of only the most recent dose. Therefore, the number of months between the most recent vaccine dose received and testing is a whole number calculated as the difference between the month and year of testing and the month and year of the most recent dose.
*** Children who received both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines were considered to have a mixed product regimen.
††† For doses received in the same month as or the month preceding SARS-CoV-2 testing, respondents were asked to specify whether the dose was received ≥2 weeks before testing if the most recent vaccination date was not directly reported. Only doses received ≥2 weeks before testing were included.
§§§ On December 9, 2022, children aged 6 months–5 years who had received 2 monovalent Moderna vaccine doses were recommended to receive a single bivalent booster dose ≥2 months after their last dose, and children aged 6 months–4 years who had received 2 monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses but had not yet received the third dose of the primary series were recommended to receive a bivalent vaccine dose as their third dose. In the analysis of Moderna VE, 38 tests were excluded from children who received a presumed bivalent third vaccine dose in December 2022 or later. In the analysis of Pfizer-BioNTech VE, 11 tests were excluded from children who received a presumed bivalent third vaccine dose in December 2022 or later.
¶¶¶ Children who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were excluded from the analyses of Moderna VE, and children who received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were excluded from the analyses of Pfizer-BioNTech VE.
**** Odds ratios were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for single year of age, gender, race, ethnicity, Social Vulnerability Index of the testing location, underlying conditions (presence versus absence), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services region, pharmacy chain conducting the test, local incidence (cases per 100,000 population by site county in the 7 days before test date), and testing calendar date.
†††† Eligibility for each product and dose number combination began on the following dates: 1 dose of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech on July 4, 2022; 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech on July 25, 2022; 2 doses of Moderna on August 1, 2022; and 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech on September 19, 2022.
§§§§ VE for 1 dose was assessed at 2 weeks–1 month after the dose (i.e., tests conducted in the same month or month following the dose) to correspond to the recommended interval between doses 1 and 2 of at least 3–8 weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech and at least 4–8 weeks for Moderna. VE for 2 Pfizer-BioNTech doses was assessed at 2 weeks–3 months after dose 2 to correspond to the recommended interval of ≥8 weeks between doses 2 and 3.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Although severe COVID-19 hospitalization and death occur more commonly among adults, young children are also affected.
What is added by this report?
As of December 31, 2022, coverage with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose among young children (those aged 6 months–4 years) was 10.1%, and 5.1% had completed the primary series. Coverage among young children varied by jurisdiction, urbanicity, race, and ethnicity. Five months after the COVID-19 vaccines became available to young children, their vaccination coverage is substantially lower than that in older children.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Enhanced evidence-based practices are needed to decrease barriers to vaccination and increase parental COVID-19 vaccine confidence to improve COVID-19 vaccination coverage among young children to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

Although severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization are more common among older adults, children can also be affected (1). More than 3 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported among infants and children aged <5 years (children) as of December 2, 2022 (2). One in four children hospitalized with COVID-19 required intensive care; 21.2% of cases of COVID-19–related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) occurred among children aged 1–4 years, and 3.2% of MIS-C cases occurred among infants aged <1 year (1,3). On June 17, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6 months–5 years and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 6 months–4 years. To assess COVID-19 vaccination coverage among children aged 6 months–4 years in the United States, coverage with ≥1 dose* and completion of the 2-dose or 3-dose primary vaccination series† were assessed using vaccine administration data for the 50 U.S. states and District of Columbia submitted from June 20 (after COVID-19 vaccine was first authorized for this age group) through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, ≥1-dose COVID-19 vaccination coverage among children aged 6 months–4 years was 10.1% and was 5.1% for series completion. Coverage with ≥1 dose varied by jurisdiction (range = 2.1% [Mississippi] to 36.1% [District of Columbia]) as did coverage with a completed series (range = 0.7% [Mississippi] to 21.4% [District of Columbia]), respectively. By age group, 9.7 % of children aged 6–23 months and 10.2% of children aged 2–4 years received ≥1 dose; 4.5% of children aged 6–23 months and 5.4% of children aged 2–4 years completed the vaccination series. Among children aged 6 months–4 years, ≥1-dose COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower in rural counties (3.4%) than in urban counties (10.5%). Among children aged 6 months–4 years who received at least the first dose, only 7.0% were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), and 19.9% were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), although these demographic groups constitute 13.9% and 25.9% of the population, respectively (4). COVID-19 vaccination coverage among children aged 6 months–4 years is substantially lower than that among older children (5). Efforts are needed to improve vaccination coverage among children aged 6 months–4 years to reduce COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality.
Data on COVID-19 vaccine administration in the United States are reported to CDC by jurisdictions, pharmacies, and federal entities through immunization information systems (IISs),§ the Vaccine Administration Management System (VAMS),¶ or through direct data submission.** Children aged 6 months–4 years residing in one of 50 states or the District of Columbia who received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose as of December 31, 2022, and whose data were reported to CDC by February 9, 2023, were included in this analysis.††
Daily and cumulative numbers of children initiating COVID-19 vaccination were calculated. Receipt of ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose and series completion among children aged 6 months–4 years were calculated overall and by age group§§ (6–23 months and 2–4 years), sex (male and female), and jurisdiction (50 states and the District of Columbia). Population size by age group and sex were obtained for the 50 states and District of Columbia from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 Population Estimates Program (4). Vaccination coverage with the first dose and series completion was calculated. Tests for statistical significance were not conducted because these data reflect the U.S. population and were not based on population samples.
Race and ethnicity data were available for 71.4% of children aged 6 months–4 years and were analyzed by the following categories: Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Asian (Asian), non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic White (White), and non-Hispanic multiple races or other (multiracial/other). The percentage of children aged 6 months–4 years receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine was calculated by race and ethnicity.
To investigate disparities in vaccination coverage by urban-rural environment, first-dose coverage was also calculated by two- and six-level urban-rural classifications according to the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) urban-rural classification scheme (6). To dichotomize counties as urban versus rural, four of these six categories (large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, medium metropolitan, and small metropolitan) were combined and considered urban areas, and two (micropolitan and noncore) were combined and considered as rural areas (6). Eight counties in California with <20,000 residents were excluded from the analysis because of data-sharing restrictions on county-level information reported to CDC. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶
As of December 31, 2022, a total of 1,755,596 (10.1%) children aged 6 months–4 years had received ≥1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (Table), and approximately 39% of these children received the first dose within 1 month of vaccine authorization (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124660). Overall, 5.1% of children in this age group completed the series during the study period (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124661). Among those who received their first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by September 4, 2022, or of Moderna vaccine by October 23, 2022, approximately 70% had completed the vaccination series.*** COVID-19 vaccination coverage with ≥1 dose varied by jurisdiction (range = 2.1% [Mississippi] to 36.1% [District of Columbia]), as it did for series completion (0.7% [Mississippi] to 21.4% [District of Columbia]), with lower coverage in the southeastern United States (Figure 1). Coverage was slightly higher among children aged 2–4 years (10.2% for ≥1 dose; 5.4% for series completion) than among those aged 6–23 months (9.7% for ≥1 dose; 4.5% for series completion). Coverage was similar among males and females.
Among vaccinated children aged 6 months–4 years, race and ethnicity were known for 71.4%. Among those with known race and ethnicity who received at least the first dose, 7.0% were Black, and 19.9% were Hispanic, whereas these groups account for 13.9% and 25.9%, respectively, of the U.S. population of children aged 6 months–4 years. In contrast, 55.3% of vaccine recipients were White, and 13.4% were Asian children; these groups account for 48.4% and 5.7% of the U.S. population of children aged 6 months–4 years, respectively (4) (Figure 2). Race and ethnicity were unknown or not reported for 501,899 (28.6%) children, either because race and ethnicity had not been recorded (24.5%), was reported as “other” (3.6%), or was not reported (0.5%) because of jurisdictional policy or law (Vermont and eight counties in California).
COVID-19 vaccination coverage with ≥1 dose was lower among children aged 6 months–4 years residing in rural counties (3.4%) than among those residing in urban counties (10.5%), according to the two-level urban-rural classification (Table). The six-level classification indicated that coverage was highest (12.5%) among children residing in large metro areas and declined as areas became more rural, with the lowest coverage (2.7%) among children residing in noncore (i.e., most rural) areas. Overall, coverage in 41 jurisdictions was higher in urban counties, in two jurisdictions (Arizona and Wyoming) was higher in rural counties, and in four jurisdictions (Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, and Nevada) coverage was similar (i.e., within two percentage points) in urban and rural counties. Coverage comparisons could not be made for four jurisdictions (Delaware, District of Columbia, New Jersey, and Rhode Island) that have only urban counties.

Discussion
Even after 5 months since COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for children aged 6 months–4 years, coverage with ≥1 dose among this age group substantially lags behind that in older children. Two months after vaccine was approved for children aged 5–11 years and 12–15 years, coverage was 24.0% and 33.3%, respectively, in these age groups (5). The low coverage to date in children aged 6 months–4 years is concerning and might indicate challenges to future vaccination coverage, especially given that bivalent booster doses are now authorized for this pediatric population as well.†††
Disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage that have emerged in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout (5) are evident among children aged 6 months–4 years. The lower coverage observed among children residing in rural counties than among those in urban counties is consistent with results from a recent survey which found that 53% of parents of children in rural areas reported that they will “probably or definitely not get their child vaccinated” with COVID-19 vaccines compared with 38% of parents in suburban areas (7). However, in Arizona and Wyoming, coverage was higher in rural counties than in urban counties; the reasons for this are not well understood and merit further investigation. Asian and White children were overrepresented among those vaccinated, whereas Black and Hispanic children were underrepresented. Several factors might contribute to these disparities. Black and Hispanic communities have high rates of poverty (19.5% and 17.0% respectively), compared with White communities (8.2%), which might affect parents’ or caregivers’ access to vaccination locations, ability to leave work for or travel to vaccination appointments, or access to primary care providers for pediatric vaccination advice (8). In a 2022 Kaiser Family Foundation survey published in July 2022, 47% of parents of children aged 6 months–4 years with household incomes ≥$90,000 reported talking to their pediatrician about a COVID-19 vaccine, compared with only 18% of parents with a household income of $40,000–$90,000 and 28% of parents with a household income of <$40,000 (9).
In addition, approximately 40% of Hispanic parents reported that they could not get the vaccine from a place they trust, and approximately one third were concerned about having to pay out-of-pocket for their child to get the vaccine compared with only 13% of White parents (9). Approximately 40% of Black parents in that survey reported concern about having to take time off from work to take their child to get vaccinated or to take care of them if they had side effects after receiving the vaccine compared with only 18% of White parents (9). Having access to a medical home§§§ and a recommendation from a trusted health care provider can help address parental concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness and can help improve pediatric COVID-19 vaccination coverage (5).
Many factors contribute to vaccine hesitancy among parents of the youngest children, ranging from worries about side effects to confusion about information regarding COVID-19 vaccines from federal health agencies (9). According to the Kaiser Family Foundation COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor, parental intention to vaccinate children in this age group has remained low, with more than one half the parents of children aged 2–4 years responding in June 2021 that they will “not vaccinate immediately” (10) and more than one half of the parents reporting that they will “definitely not” get their children aged 6 months–4 years vaccinated in September 2022.¶¶¶ Among parents of unvaccinated children aged 6 months–4 years, approximately 80% were concerned about side effects from the vaccine, and 70% were somewhat or very concerned that the vaccine would not keep their child from getting sick (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, children who received COVID-19 vaccines from different entities that used different methods for submitting data (e.g., if the first dose was given at a pharmacy and the second dose was given at a mass vaccination site) might not have their first and second doses linked, which could have led to underestimation of the percentage of children who completed the vaccination series. Second, if a child inadvertently received a different recipient identification number when receiving their second dose, first and second doses could not be linked. Third, race and ethnicity were unknown for approximately 30% of children aged 6 months–4 years, which could bias the findings. Fourth, the U.S. Census Bureau does not include “other” as a race category; however, many IIS jurisdictions might report race as “other,” which could affect the interpretation of proportions for this category. Finally, the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification was developed in 2013, and counties once classified as rural in 2013 might no longer have been rural in 2022.
An estimated 3 million COVID-19 cases and more than 500 associated deaths have been reported among children aged <5 years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (1). Children aged 6 months–4 years are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccination; public health practitioners, health care professionals, child care facility and school administrators, and state and local governments can employ evidence-based practices**** to decrease barriers to vaccination and increase confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, which can help reduce COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality among the nation’s youngest children.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
COVID-19 bivalent booster vaccination has been recommended for persons aged ≥12 years since September 1, 2022.
What is added by this report?
Based on interviews conducted during November–December 2022, only 27.1% of adults and 18.5% of adolescents who had completed a COVID-19 primary series received a bivalent booster, and coverage was lower among Black and Hispanic persons. An additional 39.4% of adults were open to booster vaccination, and an additional 52.0% of adolescents had parents who were open to booster vaccination for their children. Those in rural areas had much lower primary series completion rate and up-to-date vaccination coverage.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Health care provider recommendations for booster vaccination, dissemination of information about the safety of vaccine by trusted messengers, and reducing barriers to vaccination could improve COVID-19 booster vaccination coverage.

COVID-19 vaccine booster doses are safe and maintain protection after receipt of a primary vaccination series and reduce the risk for serious COVID-19–related outcomes, including emergency department visits, hospitalization, and death (1,2). CDC recommended an updated (bivalent) booster for adolescents aged 12–17 years and adults aged ≥18 years on September 1, 2022 (3). The bivalent booster is formulated to protect against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the original (ancestral) strain (3). Based on data collected during October 30–December 31, 2022, from the National Immunization Survey–Child COVID Module (NIS-CCM) (4), among all adolescents aged 12–17 years who completed a primary series, 18.5% had received a bivalent booster dose, 52.0% had not yet received a bivalent booster but had parents open to booster vaccination for their child, 15.1% had not received a bivalent booster and had parents who were unsure about getting a booster vaccination for their child, and 14.4% had parents who were reluctant to seek booster vaccination for their child. Based on data collected during October 30–December 31, 2022, from the National Immunization Survey–Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM) (4), 27.1% of adults who had completed a COVID-19 primary series had received a bivalent booster, 39.4% had not yet received a bivalent booster but were open to receiving booster vaccination, 12.4% had not yet received a bivalent booster and were unsure about getting a booster vaccination, and 21.1% were reluctant to receive a booster. Adolescents and adults in rural areas had a much lower primary series completion rate and up-to-date vaccination coverage. Bivalent booster coverage was lower among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) adolescents and adults compared with non-Hispanic White (White) adolescents and adults. Among adults who were open to receiving booster vaccination, 58.9% reported not having received a provider recommendation for booster vaccination, 16.9% had safety concerns, and 4.4% reported difficulty getting a booster vaccine. Among adolescents with parents who were open to getting a booster vaccination for their child, 32.4% had not received a provider recommendation for any COVID-19 vaccination, and 11.8% had parents who reported safety concerns. Although bivalent booster vaccination coverage among adults differed by factors such as income, health insurance status, and social vulnerability index (SVI), these factors were not associated with differences in reluctance to seek booster vaccination. Health care provider recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination; dissemination of information by trusted messengers about the continued risk for COVID-19–related illness and the benefits and safety of bivalent booster vaccination; and reducing barriers to vaccination could improve COVID-19 bivalent booster coverage among adolescents and adults.
NIS-CCM and NIS-ACM data were collected by telephone interview in English, Spanish, or other languages using a random-digit–dialed sample of cellular telephone numbers. Data collected during October 30–December 31, 2022,* were analyzed to assess demographic, behavioral, and social factors associated with COVID-19 primary series vaccination,†,§,¶ bivalent booster receipt,**,††,§§ up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status,¶¶ and, among adults or their children who had not received a bivalent booster dose, intent to receive booster vaccination or to get their child a booster vaccination. Receipt of an updated bivalent booster was not explicitly asked of respondents; however, only bivalent boosters were authorized after September 1, 2022 (3). Thus, a booster vaccination received after September 1, 2022, was assumed to be a bivalent booster. The cumulative NIS-CCM and NIS-ACM response rates as of December 2022 were 18.2% and 23.2%, respectively. Bivalent booster dose receipt and intention to receive (or have child receive) a booster dose were assessed among the subset of respondents who had completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series (5) (2,900 [NIS-CCM]; 83,462 [NIS-ACM]). Primary series completion and up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status were assessed among all adolescents (4,383 [NIS-CCM]) and adults (99,056 [NIS-ACM]).
Primary series completion, up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status, bivalent booster vaccination status, and intention to receive (or have one’s child receive) a booster were stratified by race and ethnicity,*** metropolitan statistical area (MSA),††† SVI,§§§ other demographic characteristics, and behavioral and social drivers of vaccination (6). Persons considered open to booster vaccination included those who reported they definitely or probably would get booster vaccination for themselves or their child. Persons considered reluctant to receive booster vaccination included those who reported they probably or definitely would not get a booster for themselves or their child. Data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SUDAAN (version 11.0.1; Research Triangle Institute). All percentages were weighted to represent the noninstitutionalized U.S. adolescent or adult population.¶¶¶ T-tests were used to determine differences between groups with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.****
From interviews conducted during November–December 2022, 58.3% of all adolescents aged 12–17 years had completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series, and 10.7% were up to date with COVID-19 vaccination (Table 1). Among adolescents who had completed a COVID-19 primary series, 18.5% had received a bivalent booster since September 1, 2022; 52.0% had not received a bivalent booster but had parents who were open to booster vaccination for their child (31.0% definitely would and 21.0% probably would), 15.1% had parents who were unsure about getting a booster vaccination for their child, and 14.4% of adolescents had parents who were reluctant to get a booster vaccination for their child. Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status among all adolescents, and bivalent booster coverage among those who had completed the primary series, increased from November (9.2% and 15.7%, respectively) to December (12.3% and 21.3%, respectively). COVID-19 primary series completion was similar among Black and White adolescents and higher among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) adolescents compared with White adolescents, while bivalent booster coverage was lower among Black (10.2%), Hispanic (14.6%), and non-Hispanic other or multiracial adolescents (14.0%) than among White (22.9%) adolescents. Adolescents who were uninsured and those living in a high SVI county had lower bivalent booster coverage compared with those who were insured and living in lower SVI counties. Reluctance to seek child’s booster vaccination was lower among Hispanic compared with White adolescents’ parents; however, reluctance to seek booster vaccination did not differ by insurance or SVI status. Adolescents in rural (non-MSA) areas had lower COVID-19 vaccine primary series completion rate and up-to-date coverage than those in MSA principal city areas.
Among adults aged ≥18 years interviewed during November–December 2022, 84.2% had completed a COVID-19 primary series, and 23.2% were up to date with COVID-19 vaccination (Table 2). Among adults who had completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series, 27.1% had received a bivalent booster, 39.4% had not yet received the bivalent booster but reported being open to booster vaccination (23.1% definitely would and 16.3% probably would), 12.4% were unsure about getting a booster, and 21.1% were reluctant to get a booster. Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status among all adults, and bivalent booster coverage among those who had completed a primary series increased from November (21.0% and 24.4%, respectively) to December (25.4% and 29.7%, respectively). Primary COVID-19 vaccination series completion was similar among White, Black, and Hispanic adults and higher among Asian adults than among those of all other races and ethnicities. Bivalent booster dose coverage was lower among Black (21.2%), Hispanic (15.0%), and Asian (25.1%) adults compared with White adults (32.1%). Bivalent booster coverage was higher among adults who had received a provider recommendation for booster vaccination (34.9%) than among those without a provider recommendation (22.2%). Bivalent booster dose coverage among adults who lived below the poverty level, were uninsured, and who lived in a moderate or high SVI county was lower than coverage among their less economically disadvantaged and lower SVI counterparts, although reluctance to seek bivalent booster vaccination generally did not differ by poverty, insurance, or SVI status. Adults in rural (non-MSA) areas had lower COVID-19 vaccine primary series completion rate and up-to-date coverage than those in MSA principal city areas.
Among all adults who had completed a COVID-19 primary series, 5.2% reported difficulty getting a booster vaccine, with a higher percentage of those open to booster vaccination (4.4%) and unsure about booster vaccination (6.6%) reporting difficulty than did those who were already vaccinated (3.6%) (Table 3). The most common barrier reported was difficulty getting an appointment (5.5% of adults). Overall, among all adults who had completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series, Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native adults were more likely to report difficulty getting a booster vaccine, and Black and Hispanic adults were less likely to report confidence about COVID-19 vaccination safety and receipt of provider recommendation for booster vaccination compared with White adults (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124394). Among adults who were open to or unsure about booster vaccination, 41.1% and 28.7%, respectively, received a provider recommendation for booster vaccination (58.9% and 71.3%, respectively, did not receive a provider recommendation), and 83.1% and 54.5% of adults, respectively, were confident about COVID-19 vaccination safety (16.9% and 45.5%, respectively, had safety concerns) (Table 3). Among adolescents with parents who were open to or unsure about booster vaccination for their children, 67.6% and 54.8% of these parents, respectively, received a provider recommendation for any COVID-19 vaccine for their child (32.4% and 45.2% did not receive a provider recommendation), and 88.2% and 54.4% of these adolescents, respectively, had parents who were confident about COVID-19 vaccination safety for their child (11.8% and 45.6%, respectively, had parents with safety concerns). Adults and parents of adolescents overwhelmingly reported that a COVID-19 vaccine is important (54%–98% across bivalent booster vaccination and booster vaccination intent categories). Over one half of adults and parents of adolescents reported that vaccination is important, even among those who were reluctance to seek a booster vaccine.

Discussion
From interviews conducted during November–December 2022, approximately 20% of adolescents aged 12–17 years and approximately 30% of adults who had completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series had received a bivalent booster dose since it was recommended on September 1, 2022. However, a large percentage of adults and parents of adolescents reported intent to receive booster vaccination for themselves or their children, indicating that booster vaccination coverage could substantially increase with appropriate interventions tailored to these reachable populations.
Reduction in disparities in completion of primary COVID-19 vaccination by race and ethnicity likely contributed to a reduction in the disparities in COVID-19 age-adjusted mortality rates that were observed early in the pandemic (7). However, bivalent booster coverage was lower among Black and Hispanic adolescents and adults compared with White adolescents and adults. Tailored and community-led interventions that helped reduce racial and ethnic inequities in primary COVID-19 vaccination could help address reported racial and ethnic differences in barriers to and attitudes toward booster vaccination. These strategies include creating and training a network of local community-trusted messengers to address misinformation and promote accurate, culturally appropriate vaccine messaging; providing vaccination in additional settings such as churches, barbershops, mass vaccination sites, or community sites; and working with culturally competent health care providers to provide a recommendation for bivalent booster vaccination.††††,§§§§
Although bivalent booster vaccination coverage among adults differed by factors such as income, health insurance status, and SVI, these factors were not associated with differences in reluctance to seek booster vaccination. This finding suggests the presence of unmeasured structural or access barriers to vaccination, even though only a small percentage of adults who had not received a booster since September 1, 2022, reported difficulties associated with cost of getting a booster vaccine or getting to a vaccination site. Patterns among adolescents were similar, with those who were uninsured and living in high SVI areas having lower booster vaccination coverage, but similar parental reluctance to vaccinate their children compared with those with higher incomes and living in less vulnerable areas. Specific barriers to booster vaccination, such as financial barriers, were not assessed in parents of adolescents.
Findings from this study suggest that provider recommendation for a COVID-19 booster dose has a positive impact on receipt of bivalent booster vaccination. However, among adults who were open to vaccination or adolescents with parents open to vaccination, more than one half of adults and one in three parents of adolescents did not receive a provider recommendation. Those who were unsure about booster vaccination for themselves or their children, and thus also potentially reachable to be vaccinated, were even less likely to have received a provider recommendation. Safety concerns about vaccination were also prevalent among those open to or unsure about booster vaccination. Provider recommendations to all patients that include culturally appropriate communication about the benefits and safety of booster vaccination and dissemination of information about the safety of vaccine by other trusted messengers could improve COVID-19 vaccination coverage (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, response rates of the NIS-CCM and NIS-ACM were low (18% and 23%, respectively). Although survey weights were calibrated to COVID-19 vaccine administration data to mitigate possible bias from incomplete sampling frame, nonresponse, and misclassification of vaccination status, bias in estimates might remain after weighting. Second, COVID-19 vaccination was self-reported and might be subject to recall or social desirability bias. Third, respondents were not specifically asked about bivalent boosters, and all boosters received after September 1, 2022, were assumed to be bivalent boosters, which might have overestimated bivalent booster coverage if some persons had received a monovalent booster after September 1, 2022. Finally, the survey sampled noninstitutionalized U.S. adults via mobile telephone; therefore, adults who were incarcerated or nursing home residents might not be represented in the sample.
A large proportion of persons who have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series have not received the bivalent booster but are open to vaccination or have parents who are open to getting a booster vaccination for their child. Ongoing monitoring of intent to receive a booster vaccination (or to have one’s child vaccinated with the booster vaccine), barriers to vaccination, and differences in bivalent booster vaccination coverage by demographic factors will be helpful for improving and expanding tailored strategies to improve vaccination coverage. To improve coverage, communities should partner with medical providers, schools, and community organizations to administer bivalent booster vaccination onsite or provide a referral for vaccination, reduce barriers to receipt of vaccination, employ trusted messengers to discuss vaccine safety and effectiveness with adults or parents and guardians of adolescents, and emphasize the importance of staying up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination (9,10).

* Approximates coverage as of November 30, 2022.
† COVID-19 vaccination status was based on responses to the questions, “Have you received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine?,” “Which brand of COVID-19 vaccine did you receive for your first dose?,” “How many doses of a COVID-19 vaccine have you received?,” and “During what month and year did you receive your most recent COVID-19 vaccine?”
§ For adolescents aged 12–17 years, primary series completion was defined as completion of a 2-dose primary COVID-19 vaccine series.
¶ For adults, primary series completion was defined as receipt of a 2-dose primary mRNA or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine series for adults who are not immunocompromised or receipt of a 3-dose mRNA or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine series for adults who reported being immunocompromised. For respondents whose initial vaccine was Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine, primary series completion was defined as receipt of a single dose primary vaccine for adults who are not immunocompromised or receipt of 2-dose series for adults who reported being immunocompromised.
** For adolescents aged 12–17 years, bivalent booster dose was defined as, since September 1, 2022, the receipt of at least a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine after completion of a 2-dose primary series.
†† For adults, bivalent booster dose was defined as receipt of at least a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine since September 1, 2022, after completion of 2-dose primary mRNA or Novavax vaccine series for adults who are not immunocompromised or at least a fourth dose of the vaccine after completion of a 3-dose mRNA or Novavax vaccine series for adults who reported being immunocompromised.
§§ For adults whose initial vaccine was a Janssen vaccine, bivalent booster dose was defined as the receipt of at least a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine since September 1, 2022, for adults who are not immunocompromised or at least a third dose for adults who reported being immunocompromised.
¶¶ Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status was defined as receipt of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series and ≥1 bivalent booster dose or, among those who had not received a bivalent booster, completion of the most recent COVID-19 vaccine dose (the most recent dose could be a primary dose or a monovalent booster dose) <2 months earlier.
*** Those who reported Hispanic ethnicity were classified as Hispanic and could be of any race. For adults, “non-Hispanic other/multiple races” included non-Hispanic adults who reported “other” race or more than one race. For adolescents, “non-Hispanic other/multiple races” included non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic other or multiple races.

At its October 2022 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices* (ACIP) approved the Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule for Ages 18 Years or Younger, United States, 2023. The 2023 child and adolescent immunization schedule, available on the CDC immunization schedule website (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules), summarizes ACIP recommendations, including several changes from the 2022 immunization schedule† on the cover page, tables, notes, and appendix. Health care providers are advised to use the tables, notes, and appendix together to determine recommended vaccinations for patient populations. This immunization schedule is recommended by ACIP (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip) and approved by CDC (https://www.cdc.gov), the American Academy of Pediatrics (https://www.aap.org), the American Academy of Family Physicians (https://www.aafp.org), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (http://www.acog.org), the American College of Nurse-Midwives (https://www.midwife.org), the American Academy of Physician Associates (https://www.aapa.org), and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (https://www.napnap.org).
ACIP’s recommendations for the use of each vaccine are developed after in-depth reviews of vaccine-related data, including the epidemiology and societal impacts of the vaccine-preventable disease, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, vaccine safety, quality of evidence, feasibility of program implementation, and economic analyses of immunization policy (1). The child and adolescent immunization schedule is published annually to consolidate and summarize updates to ACIP recommendations on vaccination of children and adolescents and to assist health care providers in implementing current ACIP recommendations. The use of vaccine trade names in this report and in the child and adolescent immunization schedule is for identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement by ACIP or CDC.
For further guidance on the use of each vaccine, including any changes that might occur after annual publication of the 2023 child and adolescent immunization schedule, health care providers are referred to the respective ACIP vaccine recommendations at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs. If errors or omissions are discovered within the schedule, CDC will post revised versions on the CDC immunization schedule website.§ Printable versions of the 2023 child and adolescent immunization schedule and instructions for ordering hard copies of the schedule are available on the immunization schedule website (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness decreased with waning of vaccine-derived immunity and emerging Omicron sublineages. An updated (bivalent) booster dose enhances protection against infection and medically attended illness, but protection against death has not been evaluated.
What is added by this report?
Bivalent booster recipients in 24 U.S. jurisdictions had slightly higher protection against infection and significantly higher protection against death than was observed for monovalent booster recipients or unvaccinated persons, especially among older adults.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Bivalent COVID-19 booster doses protected against infection and death during BA.4/BA.5 circulation. All eligible persons should get 1 bivalent booster dose ≥2 months after their COVID-19 primary series or last monovalent booster dose.

On September 1, 2022, CDC recommended an updated (bivalent) COVID-19 vaccine booster to help restore waning protection conferred by previous vaccination and broaden protection against emerging variants for persons aged ≥12 years (subsequently extended to persons aged ≥6 months).* To assess the impact of original (monovalent) COVID-19 vaccines and bivalent boosters, case and mortality rate ratios (RRs) were estimated comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated persons aged ≥12 years by overall receipt of and by time since booster vaccination (monovalent or bivalent) during Delta variant and Omicron sublineage (BA.1, BA.2, early BA.4/BA.5, and late BA.4/BA.5) predominance.† During the late BA.4/BA.5 period, unvaccinated persons had higher COVID-19 mortality and infection rates than persons receiving bivalent doses (mortality RR = 14.1 and infection RR = 2.8) and to a lesser extent persons vaccinated with only monovalent doses (mortality RR = 5.4 and infection RR = 2.5). Among older adults, mortality rates among unvaccinated persons were significantly higher than among those who had received a bivalent booster (65–79 years; RR = 23.7 and ≥80 years; 10.3) or a monovalent booster (65–79 years; 8.3 and ≥80 years; 4.2). In a second analysis stratified by time since booster vaccination, there was a progressive decline from the Delta period (RR = 50.7) to the early BA.4/BA.5 period (7.4) in relative COVID-19 mortality rates among unvaccinated persons compared with persons receiving who had received a monovalent booster within 2 weeks–2 months. During the early BA.4/BA.5 period, declines in relative mortality rates were observed at 6–8 (RR = 4.6), 9–11 (4.5), and ≥12 (2.5) months after receiving a monovalent booster. In contrast, bivalent boosters received during the preceding 2 weeks–2 months improved protection against death (RR = 15.2) during the late BA.4/BA.5 period. In both analyses, when compared with unvaccinated persons, persons who had received bivalent boosters were provided additional protection against death over monovalent doses or monovalent boosters. Restored protection was highest in older adults. All persons should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including receipt of a bivalent booster by eligible persons, to reduce the risk for severe COVID-19.
Previous reports on COVID-19 vaccine impact indicated that protection against infection and, to a lesser degree, severe illness, declined with waning of vaccine-induced immunity and emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants§ (1–4). After Omicron (BA.1) became predominant in the United States in late December 2021, Omicron sublineages BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 circulated at high prevalence; BA.4 and BA.5-related variants constituted 78% of circulating lineages by December 24, 2022. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–authorized bivalent boosters, which include an additional Omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike component, have been shown to enhance protection against infection and medically attended illness (5–7).
Weekly counts of COVID-19 cases (October 3, 2021–December 24, 2022) and associated deaths (October 3, 2021–December 3, 2022) by primary series vaccination and booster status, including bivalent boosters (the week starting September 18, 2022), were reported from 24 jurisdictions¶ that routinely link case surveillance data to immunization registries (vaccinations) and vital registration databases (deaths). Accounting for case and death reporting lags (2 weeks and 5 weeks, respectively) permitted more complete reporting, data linkage, and mortality ascertainment. Standardized definitions were used for COVID-19 cases** and COVID-19–associated deaths†† by vaccination status§§ with specimen collection dates used as reference dates; vaccinated persons who did not complete a primary COVID-19 vaccination series were excluded. Analysis periods were determined based on U.S. variant proportion estimates. Rate denominators were calculated from vaccine administration data, with numbers of unvaccinated persons estimated by subtracting numbers of persons vaccinated with at least a primary series and persons with an incomplete primary series from 2019 U.S. intercensal population estimates.¶¶ A continuity correction assumed that ≥5% of each age group and jurisdiction would always be unvaccinated (i.e., ≤95% vaccination coverage).*** Average weekly incidence and mortality were calculated during each period and stratified by age group (12–17, 18–49, 50–64, 65–79 and ≥80 years) and vaccination status; overall rates were age-standardized using the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau standard population.††† Two sets of analyses of incidence and mortality rates overall (24 jurisdictions) and by time since last monovalent or bivalent booster vaccination (23 jurisdictions) were conducted. Overall and strata-specific RRs were calculated by dividing rates among unvaccinated persons by rates among vaccinated persons; after detrending the underlying linear changes in rates, 95% CIs were calculated from the remaining variation in observed weekly rates§§§ (8,9). SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.1.2; R Foundation) were used to conduct all analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶
Among persons aged ≥12 years, a total of 21,296,326 COVID-19 cases and 115,078 associated deaths were reported during October 3, 2021–December 24, 2022, and October 3, 2021–December 3, 2022, respectively, from 24 U.S. jurisdictions (Table). Average weekly age-standardized incidence and mortality (cases and deaths per 100,000 population aged ≥12 years) increased substantially during the Omicron BA.1 period and to a lesser extent during the early BA.4/BA.5 period (Figure 1). During all periods, average weekly age-standardized incidence and mortality were consistently higher among unvaccinated persons (ranges = 216.1–1,256.0 and 1.6–15.8, respectively) than among monovalent-only vaccine recipients (ranges = 86.4–487.7 and 0.3–1.4, respectively); average weekly incidence and mortality during the late BA.4/BA.5 period were lowest among bivalent booster recipients (78.5 and 0.1, respectively).
Overall, age-standardized case RRs (unvaccinated persons compared with monovalent-only vaccine recipients) declined from 4.0 during the Delta period to 2.6 during the Omicron BA.1 and 1.8 during the Omicron BA.2 periods, before increasing to 2.7 in the early BA.4/BA.5 period. Overall case RRs (unvaccinated persons compared with bivalent booster recipients) were slightly higher (2.8) than were those for monovalent-only vaccine recipients (2.5) during the late BA.4/BA.5 period. Average, age-standardized mortality RRs in monovalent-only vaccine recipients decreased from the Delta (16.2) to BA.1 (11.5) period, then stabilized during the BA.2 (5.3), early BA.4/BA.5 (5.3), and late BA.4/BA.5 (5.4) periods. Overall mortality rates among unvaccinated persons were 14.1 times the rates among bivalent vaccine recipients; mortality rates among monovalent-only vaccine recipients were 2.6 times the rates among bivalent vaccine recipients during the late BA.4/BA.5 period. Compared with unvaccinated persons, protection among bivalent booster recipients aged 65–79 years (RR = 23.7), and ≥80 years (10.3) was significantly higher than was protection among monovalent booster recipients aged 65–79 years (8.3) and ≥80 years (4.2).
In stratified comparisons of unvaccinated persons and vaccinated persons who had received a monovalent booster dose 2 weeks–2 months earlier, progressive declines in case RRs were more pronounced between the Delta (7.0) and BA.1 (3.4), BA.2 (2.4), early BA.4/BA.5 (2.8), and late BA.4/BA.5 (2.8) periods; the case RR at 2 weeks–2 months after a bivalent booster (2.8) was the same during the late BA.4/BA.5 period (Figure 2) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124201).**** A similar reduction in the case RR was observed for both the monovalent booster at 3–5 months (2.0) and the bivalent booster at 3 months (1.7) after vaccination during the late BA.4/BA.5 period. Mortality RRs for unvaccinated persons compared with persons who received a monovalent booster dose 2 weeks–2 months earlier declined from 50.7 during the Delta period to 21.4 during the BA.1 period, 7.9 during the BA.2 period, and 7.4 during the early BA.4/BA.5 period, representing a reduction in crude vaccine effectiveness (VE) from 98% (Delta) to 87% (BA.4/BA.5).†††† During the early BA.4/BA.5 period, mortality RRs remained stable 3–5 months after receiving a monovalent booster dose (7.2) but declined to 4.6 at 6–8 months, 4.5 at 9–11 months, and 2.5 at ≥12 months. In contrast, bivalent boosters received in the preceding 2 weeks–2 months during the late BA.4/BA.5 period provided enhanced protection against death (mortality RR = 15.2 in unvaccinated persons versus bivalent booster recipients), representing a crude VE of 93%. A subset analysis of the Omicron BA.5, BA.4, and BA.2-related variant period (November 6–December 24, 2022) yielded similar results.

Discussion
This multijurisdictional report of COVID-19 case and mortality rates included two sets of analyses with different comparisons by vaccination status. In the first, overall rates among unvaccinated persons were compared to rates in persons with only monovalent doses or bivalent boosters. Receipt of bivalent booster added protection against infection and death for circulating Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages. When stratifying by time since vaccination for the second analysis, comparisons during the late BA.4/BA.5 period of monovalent and bivalent boosters found that bivalent boosters restored protection against mortality and provided similar protection against infection at 2 weeks through 2 months. Although long-term protection could not yet be assessed, evidence of waning protection against infection 3 months after bivalent booster dose receipt was observed. This study supports previous findings of protection afforded by bivalent vaccines against infection and medically attended illness during BA.4/BA.5 predominance (5–7) and provides additional evidence of enhanced protection against COVID-19–associated mortality. To date, however, bivalent booster coverage has been low (17.5% among persons aged ≥12 years).§§§§
During the early BA.4/BA.5 period, waning protection against COVID-19–associated death was observed ≥6 months after receipt of monovalent boosters, although decreases were not always statistically significant. Findings were similar to those reported in a 2021 study on waning immunity from primary COVID-19 vaccination during the Delta period (4). Patterns of waning protection against COVID-19–associated death after receiving a monovalent booster were less apparent during the late BA.4/BA.5 period; this might be related to smaller sample sizes and potential boosts to immunity over time resulting from recent infections or receipt of boosters that were not matched to existing vaccination records. Well-controlled VE studies conducted during the BA.4/BA.5 period have shown waning protection of monovalent doses against hospitalization starting at 4 months, with incremental benefits of bivalent boosters with increasing time since the last monovalent dose¶¶¶¶ (6,7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, authorizations for monovalent and bivalent boosters were not concurrent; the median time after vaccination was longer for persons who received monovalent boosters than for those who received bivalent boosters, which limits direct comparability. Second, distinguishing monovalent boosters from additional primary doses administered to immunocompromised persons was not possible, which could result in reduced RRs because of lower VE in this population. Third, this ecologic study could not adjust for important confounders that might contribute to rate differences, such as possible variations in infection-derived immunity, co-morbidities, and testing or prevention behaviors by age and vaccination status (1). Increased at-home test use has affected trends in case incidence more than trends in mortality over time (1); however, increases have been noted in COVID-19–associated deaths without laboratory-confirmation,***** which were not included in data reported by vaccination status, possibly reducing recent RRs. Fourth, national variant prevalence estimates were used, but variant prevalence differs by region. Fifth, misclassification of bivalent or monovalent boosters could influence RRs (10). Cases in bivalent booster recipients might have been preferentially identified because accounting for bivalent doses reported as first and second doses was possible, whereas distinguishing unlinked monovalent boosters from first or second doses was not possible. Finally, these data represent approximately one half of the U.S. population, and therefore, might not be generalizable.
This report presents evidence of the enhanced protection provided by bivalent COVID-19 boosters compared to monovalent vaccines against infection and death during the BA.4/BA.5 period and are consistent with other VE studies. Continued monitoring of the impact of emerging variants on VE against severe COVID-19 outcomes is needed. For the best protection against severe COVID-19, all persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, including receipt of a bivalent booster by eligible persons.

† National weighted estimates of weekly proportions of infections attributed to SARS-CoV-2 variants are based on CDC analyses (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions). Analysis periods were categorized based on variant predominance (defined as those accounting for >50% of sequenced lineages): Delta, October 3–December 18, 2021; Omicron BA.1, December 19, 2021–March 19, 2022; Omicron BA.2, March 20–June 25, 2022; early Omicron BA.4/BA.5, June 26–September 17, 2022; and late Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (only period in which bivalent boosters were recommended), September 18–December 24, 2022. A subset analysis was performed for the Omicron BA.5-, BA.4-, and BA.2-related variant period (November 6–December 24, 2022).

¶ The 24 jurisdictions included in this analysis represent 52% of the U.S. population: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia. A subset of 23 jurisdictions (50% of the US population) was included in the time since last booster vaccination analysis; New York did not provide mortality data.
** A COVID-19 case (confirmed or probable) was defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in a respiratory specimen collected per the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ update to the standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for COVID-19 (https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/ps2022/22-ID-01_COVID19.pdf). Reinfections occurring after 90 days were counted as new cases, per current guidance.
†† A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died and whose report local health authorities reviewed to make that determination (e.g., using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources). Per national guidance, this group should include persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 as an underlying cause or a significant condition contributing to death (https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CSTE-Revised-Classification-of-COVID-19-associated-Deaths.Final_.11.22.22.pdf). Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when specimens were tested for COVID-19, not the date the patient died.
§§ COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated persons and persons vaccinated with a primary series with or without a monovalent or bivalent booster dose were defined as previously described (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/hd-breakthrough.html). COVID-19 patients who had received a primary series or a monovalent booster were combined in the “vaccinated with monovalent vaccines only” category. Cases were excluded among persons who received ≥1 FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before the positive specimen collection date.

*** A continuity correction was applied to denominators by capping the percentage of population coverage at 95%. To do this, it was assumed that ≥5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population and prevents incidence and death rates from growing unrealistically large because of potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.
††† Age-standardization was performed using the direct method with the year 2000 projected U.S. population, per the 1998 directive on adjusting mortality data from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20.pdf).
§§§ 95% CIs were calculated after detrending underlying linear changes in weekly rates using piecewise linear regression. Each 95% CI represents the remaining variation in observed weekly rates and resulting RRs. The number of observations leading to each 95% CI reflects the number of weeks per period: Delta (11), Omicron BA.1 (13), Omicron BA.2 (14), early Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (12), and late Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (14).

**** The median interval in the 2 weeks–2 months since vaccination period was longer for persons who received monovalent boosters during early (60 days) and late (70 days) BA.4/BA.5 periods than for those who received bivalent boosters (47 days). The median interval among persons who received a monovalent booster 3–5 months earlier was 131 and 144 days during early and late BA.4/BA.5 periods, respectively; among those who received bivalent boosters 3–5 months earlier, the median interval was 95 days.
†††† To interpret rate ratio changes, age-standardized crude vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1 − [incidence in vaccinated / incidence in unvaccinated]) x 100%.

The number of observations leading to each 95% CI reflects the number of weeks per period: Delta (11), Omicron BA.1 (13), Omicron BA.2 (14), early Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (12), and late Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (14).
¶ Analysis periods were categorized based on variant predominance (defined as accounting for >50% of sequenced lineages): Delta, October 3–December 18, 2021; Omicron BA.1, December 19, 2021–March 19, 2022; Omicron BA.2, March 20–June 25, 2022; early Omicron BA.4/BA.5, June 26–September 17, 2022; and late Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (only period where bivalent boosters were recommended), September 18–December 24, 2022.
** Time since last monovalent booster categories was restricted to outcomes occurring during eligible weeks based on the timing of the first booster recommendation for adults aged ≥65 years and adults aged ≥18 years in high-risk groups on September 24, 2021: 2 weeks–2 months (starting October 3, 2021); 3–5 months (starting November 13, 2021); 6–8 months (starting February 13, 2022); 9–11 months (starting May 15, 2022); ≥12 months (starting August 14, 2022). For persons aged 12–17 years, boosters were recommended on January 5, 2022; data are included the week starting January 16, 2022. Bivalent boosters were included for the period starting September 18, 2022, and for categories of 2 weeks–2 months and 3 months after receipt of a booster for cases and 2 weeks–2 months after receipt of a booster for deaths. Unvaccinated persons are compared to vaccinated persons for the same time frame in each category. The median interval in the 2 weeks–2 months since vaccination period was longer for persons with monovalent boosters during early (60 days) and late (70 days) BA.4/BA.5 periods than for those who received bivalent boosters (47 days). The median interval among persons who received a monovalent booster 3–5 months earlier was 131 and 191 days, respectively, during early and late BA.4/BA.5 periods; among those who received bivalent boosters 3 months earlier, the median interval was 95 days.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and patients on dialysis are at increased risk for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections. Hemodialysis access type is a well-established risk factor for bloodstream infections, with central venous catheters having the highest associated risk.
What is added by this report?
Although vascular access type was the major risk factor for hemodialysis-associated S. aureus bloodstream infections, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors also affected infection rates and distribution, with Hispanic or Latino ethnicity as an independent risk factor.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Health care providers should prioritize prevention and optimized treatment of ESKD, identify and address barriers to lower-risk vascular access placement, and implement established best practices to prevent bloodstream infections.

Abstract
Introduction: Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). ESKD patients on dialysis are at increased risk for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections, but racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities associated with this outcome are not well described.
Methods: Surveillance data from the 2020 National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and the 2017–2020 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) were used to describe bloodstream infections among patients on hemodialysis (hemodialysis patients) and were linked to population-based data sources (CDC/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ATSDR] Social Vulnerability Index [SVI], United States Renal Data System [USRDS], and U.S. Census Bureau) to examine associations with race, ethnicity, and social determinants of health.
Results: In 2020, 4,840 dialysis facilities reported 14,822 bloodstream infections to NHSN; 34.2% were attributable to S. aureus. Among seven EIP sites, the S. aureus bloodstream infection rate during 2017–2020 was 100 times higher among hemodialysis patients (4,248 of 100,000 person-years) than among adults not on hemodialysis (42 of 100,000 person-years). Unadjusted S. aureus bloodstream infection rates were highest among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) hemodialysis patients. Vascular access via central venous catheter was strongly associated with S. aureus bloodstream infections (NHSN: adjusted rate ratio [aRR] = 6.2; 95% CI = 5.7–6.7 versus fistula; EIP: aRR = 4.3; 95% CI = 3.9–4.8 versus fistula or graft). Adjusting for EIP site of residence, sex, and vascular access type, S. aureus bloodstream infection risk in EIP was highest in Hispanic patients (aRR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2–1.7 versus non-Hispanic White [White] patients), and patients aged 18–49 years (aRR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.5–1.9 versus patients aged ≥65 years). Areas with higher poverty levels, crowding, and lower education levels accounted for disproportionately higher proportions of hemodialysis-associated S. aureus bloodstream infections.
Conclusions and implications for public health practice: Disparities exist in hemodialysis-associated S. aureus infections. Health care providers and public health professionals should prioritize prevention and optimized treatment of ESKD, identify and address barriers to lower-risk vascular access placement, and implement established best practices to prevent bloodstream infections.

Introduction
More than 800,000 persons in the United States live with ESKD, 70% of whom are treated with dialysis (89% hemodialysis and 11% peritoneal dialysis); 30% have a functioning kidney transplant (1). Race, ethnicity, and social determinants of health* affect development of ESKD (1–4). ESKD prevalence is fourfold higher among Black persons and more than twofold higher among Hispanic than among White persons (1), disparities which are thought to be attributable at least in part to underlying conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus (1–3). Furthermore, disparities in pre-ESKD nephrology care and receipt of ESKD therapies exist for these same groups, as well as those with lower income and insurance coverage (1,5–9). Black persons constitute 33% of all U.S. patients receiving dialysis (1), but only 12% of the U.S. population (10).
Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients (1). S. aureus is the most commonly isolated pathogen among bloodstream infections in hemodialysis patients reported to NHSN; 40% of those infections are methicillin resistant (MRSA)† (11). Higher rates of invasive S. aureus infections have been observed in dialysis patients compared with nondialysis patients (12).
Type of hemodialysis access is a well-established risk factor for infections; risk is highest for central venous catheters (CVCs), lower for grafts, and lowest for fistulas (11). Although elevated rates have been reported for both invasive MRSA infections among Black dialysis patients (13) and hospitalizations for dialysis-related infections among adult Black patients and older Hispanic patients (aged >60 years) (14), the association among hemodialysis-related infections, race and ethnicity, and social determinants of health is largely undescribed. To identify groups experiencing high numbers and risk of infections and to determine which preventive interventions should be prioritized, this study used a national facility-level reporting system and a laboratory- and population-based surveillance network to understand markers of disparities in the risk for S. aureus bloodstream infections in hemodialysis patients. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§

Methods
NHSN. S. aureus bloodstream infection was defined as a new positive blood culture test result reported from outpatient dialysis facilities during 2020. Dialysis facilities report bloodstream infections and vascular access in place at the time of event as well as monthly denominator data (patient-months summed from patients who received treatment during the first 2 working days of each month) by vascular access type.¶ Bloodstream infections and patient-months were categorized by type of vascular access: CVC, fistula, and graft or other. Facility-specific characteristics were reported through 2020 annual survey data. CDC/ATSDR SVI data from 2018 were linked to the facility at the county level (15).
A total of 7,097 dialysis facilities were included in this analysis. Incidences for S. aureus bloodstream infections were created by pooling events as the numerator and patient-months as the denominator for each vascular access type as reported by each facility. A statistical model** was used to assess potential associations between the main outcome of facility S. aureus bloodstream infection incidence with patient vascular access type and selected dialysis facility characteristics, including those related to infection control practices (45 variables), and SVI data (20 variables) (15).†† All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute).
EIP. S. aureus bloodstream infection data among adult hemodialysis patients (aged ≥18 years) from CDC’s EIP surveillance in selected counties from seven sites (selected counties within each state) during 2017–2020 were analyzed; data on race and ethnicity were included.§§ Sites, case definitions, and methodology have been described previously (12). EIP site staff members geocoded patient addresses to U.S. Census Bureau tracts, which were then linked to selected socioeconomic status (SES) factors for these tracts (i.e., measures of poverty, crowding, and education).¶¶
Unadjusted S. aureus bloodstream infection rates were calculated for hemodialysis patients and the general population (adults not on hemodialysis) for the surveillance area. EIP S. aureus bloodstream infection data were used as the numerator for calculating rates. The denominators for S. aureus bloodstream infection rates among hemodialysis patients were obtained as follows: for each year of data, aggregated county-level denominator data on the number of hemodialysis patients (number of hemodialysis patients as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year) were obtained from USRDS. USRDS provided the data stratified by sex, age group (18–49, 50–64, and ≥65 years), race and ethnicity, and vascular access type (analyzed as CVC versus fistula or graft) for each year. The denominator for calculating S. aureus bloodstream infection rates among the general population was obtained by subtracting the hemodialysis population from the total population of the surveillance area. Population totals for the entire surveillance catchment area (i.e., including persons not receiving dialysis) were obtained from U.S. Census Bureau data.***
Unadjusted S. aureus bloodstream infection rates among hemodialysis patients were stratified by the characteristics described in the USRDS data. To handle overdispersion, negative binomial regression was performed to determine aRRs for age, race and ethnicity, sex, vascular access type, and EIP site.

Results
NHSN. During 2020, 4,840 dialysis facilities (68.2% of 7,097 reporting to NHSN) reported 14,822 bloodstream infections; S. aureus was isolated from 5,070 (34.2%), yielding a rate of 0.1 S. aureus bloodstream infections per 100 patient-months. Among reported S. aureus bloodstream infections, 2,602 (51.3%) were identified as methicillin-sensitive and 1,923 (37.9%) as MRSA; 545 (10.7%) had no susceptibility test results reported.
Although several statistically significant differences in facility characteristics were found in univariate analyses, the best candidate model for facility S. aureus bloodstream infection incidence indicated that S. aureus bloodstream infection risk was most strongly associated with patient vascular access type: compared with fistula access, CVC and graft or other had approximately six times (aRR = 6.2; 95% CI = 5.7–6.7) and approximately two times (aRR = 2.2; 95% CI = 2.0–2.4) higher risk, respectively (Table 1). Facility characteristics with statistically significant associations with S. aureus bloodstream infection incidence included any hospital affiliation (aRR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.3–1.8), not being part of a chain of dialysis centers (aRR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2–1.7), not having a written antibiotic use policy (aRR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.1–1.4), and location of the facility in an area with a higher proportion of persons aged ≥65 years (aRR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2–1.6; between highest quartile compared with lowest quartile) (Table 1).
EIP. During 2017–2020, 2,800 S. aureus bloodstream infections among hemodialysis patients were reported in the EIP surveillance areas. The overall annual S. aureus bloodstream infection rate was 100 times higher in hemodialysis patients (4,248 of 100,000 person-years) than among adults not on hemodialysis (42 of 100,000 person-years). U.S. Census Bureau tracts with lower SES factors accounted for disproportionately higher proportions of hemodialysis-associated S. aureus bloodstream infections (Figure 1). For example, 42.1% of S. aureus bloodstream infections among patients on hemodialysis occurred in tracts in the highest quartile of population proportion living below the poverty level, versus 10.4% in tracts in the lowest poverty quartile; similar distributions of S. aureus bloodstream infections according to crowding and educational levels also occurred. The overall population for the surveillance area was distributed relatively equally across tract-based quartiles for each of the SES factors examined.
Unadjusted rates of S. aureus bloodstream infection were higher among Black and Hispanic hemodialysis patients (Figure 2) (Table 2). Other variables with higher rates included male sex, younger age groups, CVC access, and specific surveillance sites. The highest rates occurred among Black patients aged 18–49 years; 65% of bloodstream infections in this age, race, and ethnicity subgroup involved CVCs, which represented the highest prevalence of CVC use among the age, race, and ethnicity groups with bloodstream infections (range = 29%–65%). Multivariable analyses demonstrated that Hispanic ethnicity (aRR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2–1.7), male sex (aRR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1–1.4), younger age groups (patients aged 18–49 years [aRR = 1.7; 95 CI = 1.5–1.9] and patients aged 50–64 years [aRR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1–1.4] compared with patients aged ≥65 years), and specific sites were independent factors associated with higher bloodstream infection rates. However, CVC access had the strongest effect of all factors assessed. Black patients did not have significantly elevated risk when accounting for access type, age, sex, and EIP site. The proportion of hemodialysis patients who received a CVC was higher among White patients (23.1%) and Black patients (20.8%) than among Hispanic patients (13.9%).

Discussion
Although hemodialysis bloodstream infections have decreased since 2014 with the widespread implementation of evidence-based prevention strategies in dialysis facilities (e.g., staff and patient education, CVC care practices, observations of infection prevention practices, and surveillance for infections), S. aureus bloodstream infections remain an important cause of morbidity in hemodialysis patients, with rates 100 times higher in hemodialysis patients than among adults not on hemodialysis during 2017–2020. Although vascular access type was the factor most strongly associated with S. aureus bloodstream infections, disparities by race, ethnicity, and SES were also observed.
Although it is well established that race, ethnicity, and social determinants of health affect the development of ESKD and treatment options (1–3), how they relate to dialysis-related infection risk has not been as well described. In this study, the higher unadjusted S. aureus bloodstream infection rates observed in Black and Hispanic patients support the higher infection risk described in other published reports (13,14). However, whereas higher crude rates were observed in Black patients in the current study, race was not a statistically significant factor in multivariable analyses, suggesting the higher unadjusted rate might be mediated by other factors; in contrast, Hispanic ethnicity was independently associated with a 40% higher risk for S. aureus bloodstream infection. Although the effect of insurance status and lower SES could not be analyzed in the multivariable model in this report, disproportionately higher numbers of hemodialysis patients with S. aureus bloodstream infections lived in U.S. Census Bureau tracts with higher poverty, more household crowding, and lower education levels. These findings suggest that Black and Hispanic dialysis patients have higher rates of S. aureus bloodstream infections, and that lower SES might also be related to development of S. aureus bloodstream infections.
Although CVC vascular access, a known major risk factor for hemodialysis bloodstream infections (11) was most strongly associated with S. aureus bloodstream infections independent of race, ethnicity, and SES, potentially important associations between race and ethnicity and vascular access type used should also be considered. For example, recent national data suggest that initiation of hemodialysis with a CVC does not vary substantially by race, ethnicity, or SES (1), although other studies have shown associations among Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, poverty, insurance status, and shorter duration of pre-ESKD care with lower initiation with fistula (16–18). In the current study, despite having a 40% higher risk for S. aureus bloodstream infections, EIP Hispanic hemodialysis patients had a lower proportion of CVC use, which along with recent national data (1), suggest that CVC use is unlikely to be the only factor mediating this increased S. aureus bloodstream infection risk. Duration of CVC use might also be important; one study found that Black and Hispanic incident hemodialysis patients aged ≥65 years have longer use of CVC access compared with White patients, with Black patients spending on average approximately 40 more days on CVC, and Hispanic patients and those of other races spending 20–30 more days (19). Other mediating factors might include how patients with CVCs are educated about CVC care or what resources are available for such care. Although more data are needed to better define these factors, further reducing rates of CVC use among those at most risk is an important step in reducing S. aureus bloodstream infections.
The complex relationships among age, race and ethnicity, social determinants of health, and hemodialysis-associated infection risk warrant additional study. In particular, strengthening hemodialysis bloodstream infection surveillance to more comprehensively assess social determinants of health would improve understanding of risk and address some of the limitations of this report, which is subject to at least two. First, analyses of 2020 NHSN facility–reported bloodstream infection data relied on linkage with ecologic 2018 SVI data that were not patient-specific and could not be summarized below the county level. This limited the strength of conclusions that could be drawn from small but statistically significant associations of bloodstream infection rates with facility characteristics such as location in areas with higher percentages of older adults. Similarly, it is unclear whether the associations observed between bloodstream infection rates and dialysis facility affiliation or having a written antibiotic use policy are related to facility organizational structure and staffing, reporting practices, or other infection control policies. Second, and in contrast to NHSN analyses, EIP data were available on patient age, race, and ethnicity, but bloodstream infection rates by SES factors could not be calculated because U.S. Census Bureau tract–level denominator data were unavailable. Instead, the number of bloodstream infections by tract quartiles for different SES factors were calculated. These and other differences between NHSN and EIP surveillance design, including differing case ascertainment methodologies, reflect different primary surveillance purposes that have led to relatively lower bloodstream infection case estimates in NHSN (20). Overall, improved surveillance through closer linkage of existing relevant data sources and more granular surveillance data capture (e.g., patient-level information about access type, race and ethnicity, and SES), especially through automated reporting, would provide additional insight to address health disparities through specific public health interventions without increasing reporting responsibilities for health care providers.
Because disparities can affect ESKD development, access to treatment options, and risk of hemodialysis bloodstream infections, a comprehensive approach to preventive care that recognizes racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities is needed. This approach could include continued efforts to prevent and improve management of underlying conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, improved access to care for prevention and early recognition and treatment of chronic kidney disease, and increased availability of optimal treatments for ESKD, particularly in areas of lower SES. In addition, the use of cultural- and language-appropriate patient education might help patients in the care of dialysis access and infection prevention, which might be especially relevant for Hispanic patients given the higher S. aureus bloodstream infection risk observed in Hispanic persons (3). Given the importance of CVC use as a risk factor, further investigation of the determinants of CVC use and duration including possible disparities by population subgroups is needed and could further minimize CVC use and address possible barriers to lower-risk access types. Regardless, education and implementation of established best practices to prevent bloodstream infections††† are critical to protecting the entire hemodialysis patient community, including those most at risk.

** S. aureus bloodstream infection incidence was modeled using forward stage-wise negative binomial regression. Akaike and Bayesian information criteria and Wald and likelihood ratio chi-square tests were used to evaluate model fit. The best candidate model was validated using bootstrap resampling methods and independently assessed by two separate analysts. Univariate analyses were also performed using the model.
†† The SVI data set included 15 individual vulnerability subthemes, four summary themes, and one overall vulnerability index score. The method of SVI scoring involves ranking U.S. counties and assigning each one a percentile, ranging from 0 to 100, where a higher value represents greater vulnerability. SVI variables were assessed as quartiles, and all other continuous variables were assessed as deciles, quintiles, quartiles, tertiles, and at the median.
§§ Race and ethnicity were categorized as Black, Hispanic, White, and other (which includes patients with more than one race recorded). Missing race (255, 9.1%) and ethnicity (310, 11.0%) information were imputed using the respective proportions of Black, Hispanic, and White persons in the U.S. Census Bureau tract population where the patient lived and the distribution of race and ethnicity among dialysis patients with known race and ethnicity by age group, sex, and county; 10 imputed data sets were created. Descriptive results involving race and ethnicity report the mean aggregated across all 10 imputation data sets; for multivariable modeling, the SAS MIANALYZE procedure was used to incorporate results from modeling the 10 imputation data sets.
¶¶ Measures of SES included the following: 1) percentage of population living below the poverty level, 2) percentage of households with crowding (more than one occupant per room), 3) percentage of adults aged ≥25 years with less than a high school education, using 2015–2019 (for 2017–2019 cases) or 2016–2020 (for 2020 cases) 5-year U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs). U.S. Census Bureau tracts under surveillance were grouped by quartile for each measure of SES factors, and the number of S. aureus bloodstream infections occurring in tracts within each quartile of SES factors was described.

Suicide is a serious public health problem in the United States. After 2 consecutive years of declines in suicide (47,511 in 2019 and 45,979 in 2020), 2021 data indicate an increase in suicide to 48,183, nearly returning to the 2018 peak (48,344) with an age-adjusted rate of 14.1 suicides per 100,000 population (versus 14.2 in 2018).* To understand how this increase is distributed across racial and ethnic groups, CDC analyzed changes in racial and ethnic age-adjusted and age-specific suicide rates during 2018–2021.
Suicides were identified from the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files for 2018–2021. Age-adjusted rates and 95% CIs were calculated using the direct method and the 2000 U.S. standard population. Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons could be of any race, and racial groups excluded persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Persons with unknown ethnicity were excluded from race and ethnicity groups but were included in the overall total. Differences in rates from 2018 to 2021 were compared using z-tests when deaths were ≥100; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. When deaths were <100, differences in rates were considered significant if CIs based on a gamma distribution did not overlap. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†
Age-adjusted 2021 suicide rates were highest among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons (28.1 per 100,000) overall; this group also experienced the highest relative percentage change during 2018–2021 (from 22.3 to 28.1 per 100,000; a 26% increase) (Table). Age-adjusted rates also increased significantly among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons (from 7.3 to 8.7; a 19.2% increase) and for Hispanic persons (from 7.4 to 7.9; a 6.8% increase) during 2018–2021. Non-Hispanic White (White) persons were the only group to show an overall age-adjusted rate decline compared with that in 2018 (from 18.1 to 17.4; a 3.9% decline).
Suicide rates among persons aged 10–24 years increased significantly during 2018–2021 among Black persons (from 8.2 to 11.2; a 36.6% increase). Among those aged 25–44 years, rates increased significantly overall (5%) and among AI/AN (33.7%), Black (22.9%), Hispanic (19.4%), and non-Hispanic multiracial (20.6%) persons during the examined period. Rates among persons aged 45–64 years decreased significantly overall (−12.4%) and among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) (−15.9%), Hispanic (−9.3%), and White persons (−11.5%). No significant changes were noted among persons aged ≥65 years.
These analyses demonstrate disparities in suicide rates among populations based on race and ethnicity and age group in the context of overall suicide rates nearly returning to their 2018 peak after 2 years of declines. Significant increases among young Black persons aged 10–24 years and across multiple racial and ethnic populations aged 25–44 years raise particular concern. Suicide is a complex problem related to multiple risk factors such as relationship, job or school, and financial problems, as well as mental illness, substance use, social isolation, historical trauma, barriers to health care, and easy access to lethal means of suicide among persons at risk (1). Moreover, suicide rates might be stable or even decline during a disaster, only to rise afterwards as the longer-term sequalae ensue for individual persons and within families and communities (2). As the nation continues to respond to the short- and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, remaining vigilant in prevention efforts is critical, especially among disproportionately affected populations where longer-term impacts might compound preexisting inequities in suicide risk.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, children aged <10 years were excluded from age group category analyses because self-harm intent can be difficult to ascertain in young children (3). Second, age-specific rates for some racial groups could not be reported because of small numbers. Finally, racial and ethnic group designation might involve misclassification (4).
Research indicates that suicide is preventable through a comprehensive public health approach (1) that relies on data to drive decision-making, multisectoral partnerships to expand reach, and implementation and evaluation of multiple culturally relevant prevention strategies. CDC’s Suicide Prevention Resource for Action (1) supports states and communities to prioritize interventions with the best available evidence that can save lives. For persons in crisis, help is available through the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (https://www.988lifeline.org or by texting or calling 988).

† Data for Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) origin should be interpreted with caution; studies comparing Hispanic origin on death certificates and on U.S. Census Bureau surveys have shown inconsistent reporting on Hispanic ethnicity. Potential racial misclassification might lead to underestimates for certain categories, primarily American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, and other Pacific Islander decedents. Single-race estimates are presented and might not be comparable to earlier years produced by bridging multiple races to a single race choice. Hispanic ethnicity includes persons of any race. Racial groups exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Persons with unknown ethnicity are excluded from race and ethnicity groups but are included in the overall total.
§ Age-adjusted rates (suicides per 100,000 population) were calculated using the direct method and the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau standard population.
¶ Rates are flagged as unreliable or suppressed when the rate is calculated with a numerator of <20, or the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints (<10 deaths).

In 2021, among adults aged ≥45 years, men were more likely to use a hearing aid than were women (9.2% versus 5.5%). This pattern was found in all age groups: 3.0% of men versus 1.4% of women among those aged 45–64 years, 12.3% versus 5.7% among those aged 65–74 years, 26.7% versus 13.7% among those aged 75–84 years, and 39.5% versus 31.5% among those aged ≥85 years. Among both men and women, the percentage who use a hearing aid increased with age.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
COVID-19 vaccines are safe and reduce COVID-19 mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries prioritize populations at increased risk, e.g., older adults, for COVID-19 vaccination with a goal of 100% coverage with a completed primary series for populations at-risk.
What is added by this report?
COVID-19–associated mortality among persons aged ≥60 years exceeded 80% of total COVID-19 mortality in 2020 and 2021 across all income groups; however, the median reported completed primary series coverage among older adults in 2022 was 76%, substantially below the WHO goal, especially in middle- and low-income countries.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Efforts are needed to increase COVID-19 primary series and periodic booster dose coverage among older adults as recommended by WHO and national health authorities.

After the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, transmission expanded globally, and on January 30, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern.* Analysis of the early Wuhan, China outbreak (1), subsequently confirmed by multiple other studies (2,3), found that 80% of deaths occurred among persons aged ≥60 years. In anticipation of the time needed for the global vaccine supply to meet all needs, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) Values Framework and a roadmap for prioritizing use of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020 (4,5), followed by a strategy brief to outline urgent actions in October 2021.† WHO described the general principles, objectives, and priorities needed to support country planning of vaccine rollout to minimize severe disease and death. A July 2022 update to the strategy brief§ prioritized vaccination of populations at increased risk, including older adults,¶ with the goal of 100% coverage with a complete COVID-19 vaccination series** for at-risk populations. Using available public data on COVID-19 mortality (reported deaths and model estimates) for 2020 and 2021 and the most recent reported COVID-19 vaccination coverage data from WHO, investigators performed descriptive analyses to examine age-specific mortality and global vaccination rollout among older adults (as defined by each country), stratified by country World Bank income status. Data quality and COVID-19 death reporting frequency varied by data source; however, persons aged ≥60 years accounted for >80% of the overall COVID-19 mortality across all income groups, with upper- and lower-middle–income countries accounting for 80% of the overall estimated excess mortality. Effective COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for use in December 2020, with global supply scaled up sufficiently to meet country needs by late 2021 (6). COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective in reducing severe COVID-19, hospitalizations, and mortality (7,8); nevertheless, country-reported median completed primary series coverage among adults aged ≥60 years only reached 76% by the end of 2022, substantially below the WHO goal, especially in middle- and low-income countries. Increased efforts are needed to increase primary series and booster dose coverage among all older adults as recommended by WHO and national health authorities.
Comparative analysis of COVID-19 deaths and mortality rates by age group during 2020–2021 was conducted using three publicly available WHO data sources: 1) daily country-specific number of reported cases and deaths (aggregate surveillance); 2) weekly country-specific age, sex, and health care worker status of disaggregated cases and deaths (detailed reporting)††; and 3) WHO-modeled COVID-19 excess mortality estimates§§ (9). Because the quality of reported data on COVID-19 deaths appeared to vary among countries by income group, the country-specific ratio of excess mortality estimates to total aggregate reported deaths was mapped geographically to reflect the difference in number of deaths by data source. Because the excess mortality model included all countries and accounted for variability in death reporting, it was used to examine mortality rate¶¶ and relative risk for persons aged ≥60 years, stratified by World Bank income group (high, upper-middle, lower-middle, and low), independent of potential data quality differences. Percent coverage with a completed COVID-19 vaccination series for the overall population and for older adults were drawn from reporting countries through the WHO electronic Joint Reporting Form COVID-19 module and WHO Regional Office reporting systems. The definition of older adult varied by country; therefore, older adult vaccination coverage was calculated using each country’s definition and dividing the doses reported administered to those older adults by the United Nation’s Population Division age-specific population figures. The 40 countries that did not report vaccination coverage for older adults in 2021 and 2022 were excluded from analysis. WHO data were accessed through the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership Information Hub.***,††† Data were analyzed and visualized using R statistical software (version 4.1.1; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§
During January 2020–December 2021, daily aggregate surveillance and weekly detailed reporting recorded 5.4 million and 2.5 million COVID-19–associated deaths, respectively; the WHO model estimated 14.9 million excess deaths (Table). COVID-19 mortality rates increased markedly in older age groups: persons aged ≥60 years accounted for 80% of COVID-19–associated deaths reported through weekly detailed surveillance and 82% of estimated deaths from the WHO excess mortality model. Among 73% of low-income countries and 31% of lower-middle–income countries (mostly in the WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean, and European regions), the estimated excess mortality exceeded the total reported deaths through aggregate surveillance by more than tenfold, whereas this difference was less than twofold in most higher-income countries (Figure 1). Despite the difference in reporting completeness by income group, cumulative deaths and mortality were higher among older age groups in all income groups. Upper- and lower-middle–income countries accounted for 81% of the global excess mortality among persons aged ≥60 years¶¶¶ (Table). Lower-middle–income countries accounted for 52% of excess deaths worldwide among persons aged ≥60 years, with an annual excess mortality rate of 1,039 per 100,000 persons.
As of December 2022, among 194 countries, 154 (79%) had reported both overall and older adult COVID-19 vaccination coverage at least once to WHO; ≥78% of countries in all income groups reported coverage during the last three months of 2022.**** The median overall completed primary series COVID-19 vaccination coverage was 59%, ranging from a low of 21% (low-income countries) (50% [upper-middle–income] and 51% [lower-middle–income]) to a high of 74% (high-income countries). Only high-income countries’ median coverage surpassed the global target of 70% for the overall population. Among older adults, the median completed primary COVID-19 vaccination series coverage was 76%, ranging from 33% (low-income countries) to 90% (high-income countries). Median coverage among older adults in lower-middle– and upper-middle–income countries was 73% and 70%, respectively. Reported coverage among both the overall population and among older adults varied among countries within and among different income groups (Figure 2). Coverage among older adults was the same or lower than that in the overall population in 36 (23%) countries, including four high-income, eight upper-middle–income, 14 lower-middle–income, eight low-income, and two nonclassified countries.††††

Discussion
The impact of COVID-19 during the last 3 years has been substantial, and COVID-19 mortality is an important outcome indicator for monitoring the pandemic. These COVID-19 deaths and excess mortality estimates showing that persons aged ≥60 years accounted for more than 80% of total COVID-19 deaths even when controlling for income levels are consistent with the initial SARS-CoV-2–related mortality patterns described in China and subsequently by other countries (1–3). The large disparity observed between reported deaths and estimated excess mortality, especially in upper-middle–, lower-middle–, and low-income countries, makes ascertaining true COVID-19–associated mortality challenging. Given the bias in reported numbers of age-disaggregated COVID-19 deaths by income group, excess mortality estimates based on modeling might provide a more accurate measure of the impact of the pandemic.§§§§ The modeled estimates accounted for limited testing and country-specific reporting of causes of death, particularly as many low- and middle-income countries were known to have faced higher numbers of COVID-19–associated deaths because of insufficient health care capacity. Based on the modeled estimates, persons aged ≥60 years in lower-middle–income countries accounted for more than one half of the global estimated COVID-19 mortality and experienced the highest mortality rate.
COVID-19 vaccines, which have received WHO Emergency Use Listing,¶¶¶¶ were introduced in December 2020, <1 year after the first COVID-19 cases were reported. These vaccines have been found to be safe and highly effective in reducing severe COVID-19, hospitalizations, and mortality; however, despite available evidence on effectiveness (7,8), reported COVID-19 vaccination coverage among older adults has not yet come close to the WHO goal of 100% in many parts of the world. Approximately one quarter of countries reported lower coverage among older adults compared with that in the overall population; many of these countries are in the upper- and lower-middle–income groups, with the highest mortality estimated by the excess mortality model. Further, because of limitations in access to vaccines in many low- and middle-income countries and limited capacity to rapidly roll out COVID-19 vaccines, middle- and low-income countries are taking longer to reach the recommended targets for primary series and booster dose coverage as recommended by WHO and national health authorities.***** As the fourth year of the pandemic begins, vaccine booster doses have been shown to restore or enhance protection against infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease, beyond that originally afforded by the primary series (10). This is particularly important because most countries have ended most mandated public health and behavioral measures to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, age-disaggregated mortality and vaccination data were self-reported by countries with different reporting frequencies, limited data verification processes, and varying capacity for reporting up-to-date information. As a result, reported vaccination coverage rates included in the analysis might be lower than the countries’ published figures because of nonreporting to WHO. Second, the WHO-modeled excess mortality data included all countries and age groups available for 2020 and 2021, but not yet for 2022. Thus, direct association between COVID-19 mortality and vaccination coverage among older adults was not examined in this analysis. Future analyses could be conducted with more regular reports and more availability of detailed data, including vaccination status for reported deaths.
With both timely and reliable data necessary for accurate monitoring of global targets, countries need to be able to strengthen COVID-19 surveillance and vaccination reporting systems to provide better and more detailed data to guide public policies. The collection of accurate disaggregated data by age, and by vaccination dose (i.e., primary series and booster doses), will be critical to monitoring progress in achieving coverage targets among older adults at highest risk for COVID-19–associated death. Because vaccination rates among older adult populations remain below the recommended global vaccination target of 100%, efforts are needed to understand and address the reasons that target populations are not reached by current vaccination programs, while integrating COVID-19 vaccination into primary care systems to facilitate completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series and receipt of booster doses recommended by WHO and national health authorities for all older adults.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2-related sublineage XBB.1.5 is gaining predominance nationwide. Vaccine effectiveness against XBB and XBB.1.5 is unknown.
What is added by this report?
Using spike (S)-gene target presence as a proxy for BA.2 sublineages, including XBB and XBB.1.5, during December 2022–January 2023, the results showed that a bivalent mRNA booster dose provided additional protection against symptomatic XBB/XBB.1.5 infection for at least the first 3 months after vaccination in persons who had previously received 2–4 monovalent vaccine doses.
What are the implications for public health practice?
As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, continued vaccine effectiveness monitoring is important. All persons should stay up to date with recommend COVID-19 vaccines, including receiving a bivalent booster dose when eligible.

The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineage XBB was first detected in the United States in August 2022.* XBB together with a sublineage, XBB.1.5, accounted for >50% of sequenced lineages in the Northeast by December 31, 2022, and 52% of sequenced lineages nationwide as of January 21, 2023. COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary by SARS-CoV-2 variant; reduced VE has been observed against some variants, although this is dependent on the health outcome of interest. The goal of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program is to prevent severe disease, including hospitalization and death (1); however, VE against symptomatic infection can provide useful insight into vaccine protection against emerging variants in advance of VE estimates against more severe disease. Data from the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) national pharmacy program for SARS-CoV-2 testing were analyzed to estimate VE of updated (bivalent) mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection caused by BA.5-related and XBB/XBB.1.5-related sublineages among immunocompetent adults during December 1, 2022–January 13, 2023. Reduction or failure of spike gene (S-gene) amplification (SGTF) in real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a proxy indicator of infection with likely BA.5-related sublineages and S-gene target presence (SGTP) of infection with likely XBB/XBB.1.5-related sublineages (2). Among 29,175 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) with SGTF or SGTP results available from adults who had previously received 2–4 monovalent COVID-19 vaccine doses, the relative VE of a bivalent booster dose given 2–3 months earlier compared with no bivalent booster in persons aged 18–49 years was 52% against symptomatic BA.5 infection and 48% against symptomatic XBB/XBB.1.5 infection. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, continued vaccine effectiveness monitoring is important. Bivalent vaccines appear to provide additional protection against symptomatic BA.5-related sublineage and XBB/XBB.1.5-related sublineage infections in persons who had previously received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses. All persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including receiving a bivalent booster dose when they are eligible.
ICATT is designed to increase access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in areas with high social vulnerability† through testing at selected pharmacy- and community-based testing sites nationwide.§ ICATT VE methods have been described previously (3,4). Briefly, at test registration, adults report information on vaccination history,¶ current COVID-19–like illness symptoms, previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and underlying medical conditions. Adults receiving testing at participating sites during December 1, 2022–January 13, 2023, who reported one or more COVID-19–like illness symptoms were included. For this analysis, eligible tests were those performed at a commercial laboratory that used the real-time RT-PCR TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (ThermoFischer Scientific); quantitative results were reported as cycle threshold (Ct) values for each of three SARS-CoV-2 gene targets (S, N, and ORF1ab). Specimens with missing Ct values for N or ORF1ab were excluded. SARS-CoV-2–positive specimens with either null or reduced amplification of the spike S-gene (Ct for S-gene >4 cycles from the average of N and ORF1ab Ct values) were considered to have SGTF (5); SARS-CoV-2–positive specimens without SGTF were considered to exhibit SGTP. SGTF or SGTP can serve as a proxy marker of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and sublineages with or without a deletion of amino acids 69–70 in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, respectively (5). Currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants were classified by SGTF (BQ.1.1, BQ.1, BF.7, and other BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages) and SGTP (XBB.1.5, XBB, BN.1, and other BA.2 sublineages). During the week ending December 3, 2022, approximately 13% of specimens sequenced nationwide were BA.2 sublineages, including 2.4% XBB.1.5 (95% CI = 0.6%–6.2%) and 5.0% XBB (95% CI = 3.7%–6.6%); by the end of the analytic period, these proportions had risen to approximately 41%, including 37.2% XBB.1.5 (95% prediction interval [PI] = 26.8%–49.0%) and 4.0% XBB (95% PI = 3.3%–4.7%).**
Case-patients were persons who received a positive laboratory-based NAAT result classified as SGTF (BA.5-related) or SGTP (XBB/XBB.1.5-related); control-patients were those who received a negative NAAT result. Tests among persons fulfilling any of following criteria were excluded from analyses: 1) presence of an immunocompromising condition††; 2) unvaccinated or receipt of only 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; 3) receipt of a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine; 4) receipt of >4 monovalent mRNA doses if aged ≥50 years or >3 monovalent doses if aged 18–49 years; or 5) receipt of only 2 mRNA doses, with the second dose received <4 months before the SARS-CoV-2 test. Persons reporting an mRNA booster dose on or after September 1, 2022, were assumed to have received a bivalent dose because monovalent mRNA doses were not authorized for use as booster doses at that time.§§ In addition, tests from persons who reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during the preceding 90 days¶¶ were excluded to avoid analyzing multiple tests for the same illness episode or reinfections within a relatively short time frame. Relative VE of a bivalent booster dose was calculated by comparing odds of receipt of a bivalent booster dose with those of no bivalent booster dose among persons who had received 2–4 monovalent vaccine doses. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression***; VE was calculated separately based on SGTF/SGTP status as (1 − OR) x 100.
As of January 16, 2023, genomic sequencing data were available for a random subset of ICATT specimens with SGTP and collection dates through January 2, showing an increase in XBB.1.5 prevalence over time. During December 1, 2022–January 2, 2023, XBB.1.5 comprised 33% (495) of specimens exhibiting SGTP. During the interval December 11–January 2, XBB.1.5 accounted for 38% of sequenced ICATT specimens with SGTP (377), and during the interval December 18–January 2, XBB.1.5 accounted for 43% of sequenced ICATT specimens with SGTP (252)(2). As XBB.1.5 has continued to increase nationwide, true proportions of XBB.1.5 in the analytic dataset, which included tests through January 13, were likely higher, but sequencing results were not yet available for specimens collected during the whole period. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using two intervals, December 11, 2022–January 13, 2023, and December 18, 2022–January 13, 2023, to assess the effect of different proportions of the XBB.1.5 sublineage among SGTP cases during early December. Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.2; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†††
Among 29,175 NAAT results among persons with COVID-19–like illness symptoms eligible for this analysis, 13,648 (47%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 10,596 (78%) with SGTF (BA.5-related) and 3,052 (22%) with SGTP (XBB/XBB.1.5-related) (Table 1). More control-patients who received negative SARS-CoV-2 test results reported having received a bivalent COVID-19 mRNA booster (34%) than did case-patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (SGTF = 22%; SGTP = 21%). Among those who had received only monovalent vaccine doses, 45% reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result >90 days before the current test, compared with 34% among those who received a bivalent dose. Among those who had received only monovalent vaccine doses, the median interval since the last dose was 13 months (IQR = 11–17) for case-patients and 13 months (IQR = 11–18) for control-patients.
Across age groups, VE was generally similar against BA.5-related infections and XBB/XBB.1.5-related infections. VE against symptomatic BA.5-related infection was 52% among persons aged 18–49 years, 43% among persons aged 50–64, and 37% among those aged ≥65 years (Table 2). VE against symptomatic XBB/XBB.1.5-related infection was 49% among persons aged 18–49, 40% among persons aged 50–64 years, and 43% among those aged ≥65 years. Evidence of waning VE by 2–3 months after receiving a bivalent dose based on point estimates was minimal, although estimates were imprecise. Sensitivity analyses did not show a meaningful change in VE by different analytic period start dates (Table 3).

Discussion
This report provides the first estimates of bivalent mRNA COVID-19 VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with XBB-related sublineages. These preliminary estimates from national pharmacy testing conducted during December 1, 2022–January 13, 2023, showed relative bivalent booster dose VE (compared with 2–4 monovalent doses) to be similar for XBB/XBB.1.5 sublineage–related infections and BA.5 sublineage–related infections. VE estimates for both sublineages included in this analysis were similar to estimates from the same ICATT network published during a period of Omicron BA.5, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1 sublineage circulation in fall 2022 (6).
Early immunogenicity studies indicating lower neutralizing activity against XBB compared with other Omicron sublineages after receiving a bivalent booster dose compared with that against other Omicron sublineages (7) have raised concerns about potential reduction in VE against these emerging variants. Bivalent boosters contain mRNA encoding the S-gene from the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages (8); XBB and XBB.1.5, however, are descendants of the Omicron BA.2 sublineage.§§§ Findings from this study suggest that bivalent booster doses are continuing to provide additional protection against symptomatic infection for at least the first 3 months after vaccination in persons who had previously received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses, which supports recommendations to continue to increase bivalent booster coverage.
The SGTP data in these analyses include infections with a mix of XBB, XBB.1.5, and other BA.2-related sublineages. Among specimens collected during December 1, 2022–January 2, 2023, with SGTP and with genomic sequencing results available, XBB accounted for 26%, and XBB.1.5 accounted for 33%. Together XBB/XBB.1.5 accounted for >50% of specimen sequences, which is a typical threshold considered for variant predominance in ecologic studies of variant VE (8). XBB.1.5, which is gaining predominance nationwide, includes one additional change in the spike receptor-binding domain compared with XBB, but it is currently unclear how this mutation might affect VE. Sensitivity analyses that assessed a subset of data from later in the analytic period when XBB.1.5 represented a larger proportion of SGTP specimens did not show differences in VE; however, because circulating variants in the United States continue to change, VE should continue to be monitored.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, vaccination status, previous infection history, and underlying medical conditions were self-reported and might be subject to recall bias. Self-reported frequency of previous infections differed by vaccination status, test result positivity, and SGTF status, but statistical power was not adequate to stratify by presence of previous infection >90 days earlier. Further, previous infection is likely underreported (9). Previous infection provides some protection against repeat infection (10); therefore, VE estimates in this study might be biased toward no effect. Second, bivalent booster dose coverage to date has been low (6%–39% among persons aged ≥18 years among different age groups as of January 14, 2023),¶¶¶ which could bias results if persons getting vaccinated earlier are systematically different from those vaccinated later. Third, data on SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk and mask use were not collected; biases might also arise because of differences in testing behaviors between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, which might result in residual confounding. Finally, this analysis did not control for time since last monovalent dose; however, because monovalent VE against symptomatic infection with Omicron sublineages wanes quickly (4), this likely had a minimal effect on results.
Findings from this analysis of national pharmacy testing data show that a bivalent mRNA booster dose provided added protection against symptomatic XBB/XBB.1.5 infection for at least the first 3 months after vaccination in persons who had previously received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses. All persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including receiving a bivalent booster dose when eligible.

§ https://www.cdc.gov/icatt/index.html
¶ Test registrants who report receiving COVID-19 vaccines were asked to report the total number of doses and manufacturers of vaccines received and, for the most recent dose, month and year of receipt; therefore, the number of months between a vaccine dose and testing is a whole number calculated as the difference between the month and year of testing and the month and year of receipt of the vaccine dose. For doses received in the same month or the month before SARS-CoV-2 testing, an additional question was asked to specify whether the dose was received ≥2 weeks before testing; only those doses received ≥2 weeks before testing were included.
** As of January 21, 2023. Variant proportions for the most recent 3 weeks are model-based projections using the Nowcast. These projections can be uncertain or fluctuate within a wide prediction interval when a variant is just beginning to spread (i.e., has a low number of sequences and has a growth rate that is unstable). A prediction interval is an estimate of an interval in which a future observation will fall, based on what has already been observed. https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions

Monitoring emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages and their epidemiologic characteristics helps to inform public health decisions regarding vaccine policy, the use of therapeutics, and health care capacity. When the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant emerged in late 2020, a spike gene (S-gene) deletion (Δ69–70) in the N-terminal region, which might compensate for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity (1), resulted in reduced or failed S-gene target amplification in certain multitarget reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, a pattern referred to as S-gene target failure (SGTF) (2). The predominant U.S. SARS-CoV-2 lineages have generally alternated between SGTF and S-gene target presence (SGTP), which alongside genomic sequencing, has facilitated early monitoring of emerging variants. During a period when Omicron BA.5–related sublineages (which exhibit SGTF) predominated, an XBB.1.5 sublineage with SGTP has rapidly expanded in the northeastern United States and other regions.
As part of the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) program,* specimens collected at a national pharmacy chain were tested at a commercial laboratory that exclusively used the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) (3). Real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) results for three gene targets (S, N, and ORF1ab) were reported to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Protect† during November 1, 2021–January 14, 2023. The proportion of SGTF or SGTP§ (2) results was calculated weekly at the national and HHS regional levels¶; SGTF data were reported on a public dashboard.** CDC also collects genomic sequencing data from the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance program,†† contracted commercial laboratories, and partners that label sequencing results in public repositories as baseline surveillance (4). Sequencing data are used to calculate variant proportions, which are published weekly on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker.§§ Genomic sequencing results lag 2–3 weeks behind specimen collection, which necessitates nowcasting estimates (4) for the most recent 3 weeks (December 25, 2022–January 14, 2023). Geographic representativeness and median interval from specimen collection to result were calculated for both data sources. Trends were assessed in SGTP proportions, variant proportions, and nowcast estimates; all were weighted to represent RT-PCR–positive specimens by state (4). Genomic sequencing results, including for a random sample of ICATT specimens, were assessed by SGTF/SGTP status. This activity was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶
During November 1, 2021–December 24, 2022, national weekly SGTF and SGTP results ranged from 3,104 to 83,805 (median = 102; IQR = 327 per jurisdiction***) and genomic sequencing results ranged from 6,313 to 69,280 (median = 195; IQR = 460 per jurisdiction†††). During December 25, 2022–January 14, 2023, the national weekly average number of SGTF/SGTP and sequencing results were 5,005 and 847, respectively. After specimen collection, SGTF/SGTP results were available sooner (median = 2 days; IQR = 1) than were genomic sequencing results (median = 16 days; IQR = 10).
Trends in SGTP proportions aligned with genomic sequencing results classified by SGTF and SGTP (Figure). For the week ending December 24, 2022, the latest week that weighted variant proportions were available from genomic sequencing, SGTP lineages accounted for 21.5% (XBB.1.5 = 11.8%; XBB = 4.4%; other BA.2-related sequences = 5.3%) of genomic sequences, while the weighted SGTP estimate from ICATT was 20% (95% CI = 18%–23%). For the week ending January 14, 2023, the SGTP estimate from ICATT was 40% (95% CI = 36%–45%); SGTP lineages from sequencing comprised 50.6% (XBB.1.5 = 43.0%; XBB = 3.9%; other BA.2-related sequences=3.7%) of lineages in the nowcast projections reported on January 13, 2023 and 45.5% (XBB.1.5 = 37.2%; XBB = 4.0%; other BA.2-related sequences=4.3%) of lineages in revised nowcast projections for the same week, subsequently reported on January 20, 2023%.§§§ SGTP accounted for >50% of specimens in HHS regions 1–3 and >20% in all other regions, except Region 10, where the estimated precision was low (Supplementary Figure; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/123810). Among genomic sequences from ICATT specimens collected through January 2, 2023, 412 (99%) of 415 XBB-related sequences exhibited SGTP; among those collected during December 1, 2022–January 2, 2023, 294 (59%) of 495 SGTP specimens were XBB-related lineages.
SGTF/SGTP monitoring relies on diagnostic RT-PCR, which is less expensive, permits higher throughput, and faster turnaround of results than sequencing. Using SGTF/SGTP for early studies of emerging variants obviates the need to wait for sequencing results or >50% variant predominance. Limitations are that SGTF/SGTP monitoring is assay-dependent; presumes SARS-CoV-2 lineage classification, requiring further validation by genomic surveillance; cannot discriminate mutations beyond Δ69–70 (i.e., BA.2-related sequences or even between BA.4 and BA.5); and relies on continued changing SGTF/SGTP patterns compared with predominant lineages. SARS-CoV-2 sequencing remains the standard for genomic surveillance because it allows definitive classification of viral lineages and identification of emerging strains for further characterization.
When early nowcast estimates of rapidly emerging variants lacked precision and geographic resolution because of lags in genomic sequencing results, SGTF/SGTP estimates were used as complementary data by CDC and the SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group to support guidance on the use of monoclonal antibody therapies.¶¶¶ SGTF/SGTP data were also used as proxy markers in several early studies of vaccine effectiveness and severity of emerging variants (3,5,6). Continued monitoring of SGTF/SGTP patterns will likely serve as a useful complement to genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

As of January 20, 2023, >90% of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States, specifically Omicron BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1.5 sublineages, are unlikely to be susceptible to the combined monoclonal antibodies, tixagevimab and cilgavimab (Evusheld) used for preexposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection (1). The Food and Drug Administration announced on January 26, 2023, that Evusheld is not currently authorized for preexposure prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States (2). It is important that persons who are moderately to severely immunocompromised,* those who might have an inadequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination, and those with contraindications to receipt of COVID-19 vaccines, exercise caution and recognize the need for additional preventive measures (Box). In addition, persons should have a care plan that includes prompt testing at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and rapid access to antivirals if SARS-CoV-2 infection is detected.

COVID-19 vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent SARS-CoV-2–associated serious illness, hospitalization, and death. All persons, including those who are immunocompromised and their household members and close contacts, should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, and receive the updated (bivalent) booster dose, when eligible.† Although persons who are moderately to severely immunocompromised might not mount a strong vaccine-mediated immune response, staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination§ does provide some protection (3,4). A recent CDC study of preliminary data showed that a bivalent booster dose provided additional protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among immunocompetent persons who had previously received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses (4).
Despite evidence of vaccine effectiveness, coverage with the bivalent booster dose across the United States remains low. As of January 18, 2023, 15.3% of persons aged ≥5 years had received a bivalent booster dose (5). CDC recommends that all eligible persons aged ≥6 months receive 1 bivalent booster dose. Persons are eligible for a bivalent booster dose if they are aged 6 months–5 years and have completed a Moderna COVID-19 primary series ≥2 months earlier. Persons aged 6 months–4 years and who received a 2-dose Pfizer COVID-19 primary series ≥8 weeks earlier can receive the bivalent booster as their third dose.
Among persons with immunocompromise and their household members and close contacts, prevention measures¶ including wearing a high-quality and well-fitting mask,** maintaining physical distance from others (≥6 ft [1.8 m]), improving indoor ventilation,†† practicing frequent handwashing, and developing a care plan,§§ should be considered in addition to receipt of a bivalent booster dose. It is important to wear a mask and maintain physical distance from others if it is not possible to avoid crowded indoor spaces. In addition, simple interventions should be used to improve ventilation in buildings and decrease SARS-CoV-2 transmission by improving air flow. CDC has developed interactive tools¶¶ to help identify ways to improve ventilation in the home. In-duct ultraviolet germicidal irradiation lights can also be added to home heating ventilation and air conditioning systems to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 as air passes through the system.*** Frequent handwashing with soap and water is the best way to eliminate germs in most situations. If soap and water are not readily available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing ≥60% alcohol is a good alternative. Also, it is important for persons who are immunocompromised to develop a care plan in consultation with their physician, in the event that they develop COVID-19.
Persons with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 who 1) are aged ≥50 years, 2) have an underlying health condition††† (especially moderate to severe immunosuppression), or 3) are unvaccinated are at risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes. Irrespective of vaccination status, symptomatic persons who are immunocompromised, their household members, and their close contacts should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as possible and receive treatment within 5–7 days of symptom onset. Early outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 with a recommended first-line therapy, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) or remdesivir (Veklury), or the second-line therapy, molnupiravir (Lagevrio), have been shown to reduce the risk for severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and death.§§§ These medications are expected to retain activity against the currently circulating Omicron sublineages (6) and are widely available.¶¶¶ Available COVID-19 treatment does not supplant the need for persons to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations, which are highly effective at preventing COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality.

In 2021, approximately one third (32.8%) of persons of all ages had a telemedicine appointment with a doctor, nurse, or other health professional during the past 12 months. The percentage with a telemedicine appointment increased with age, from 17.2% among children aged <10 years to 45.5% among adults aged 70–79 years, and then decreased to 39.3% among adults aged ≥80 years. Telemedicine use among adults aged ≥80 years was similar to that among adults aged 40–49, 50–59, and 60–69 years.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Physical activity is important in health promotion and disease prevention; rural-urban and regional disparities among adults in meeting the combined leisure time physical activity guidelines exist.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of 2020 National Health Interview Survey data found a low proportion of U.S. adults met leisure-time aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined physical activity guidelines. Residents in larger metropolitan areas and in the West U.S. Census Bureau region were more likely than were those in less populated urban and rural areas or other regions to meet these guidelines.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Rural residents might benefit from investments in structural capacity and policy, systems, and environment change to support leisure-time physical activity.

Table 1
Table 2
The healthful effects of physical activity on a multitude of physical and mental health outcomes are well documented (1). Despite promising increases in the percentage of U.S. adults meeting aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity guidelines (guidelines)* (1) during leisure time in nearly all demographic and regional subgroups 1998–2018 (2,3), differences by rurality and U.S. Census Bureau region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), persist (4). Before 2020, analyses of rural-urban differences were dichotomized into nonmetropolitan (rural) versus metropolitan (urban) areas; however, in 2020 a four-category rural-urban variable† to classify rural-urban status was included in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) public-use dataset. NHIS 2020 data were used to conduct multivariate logistic regression analyses by rural-urban status and U.S. Census Bureau region of the prevalence of meeting the aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines during leisure time among adults aged ≥18 years, controlling for demographic characteristics. Prevalence of meeting the aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines was consistently the lowest in Nonmetropolitan counties (38.2%, 21.1%, and 16.1%, respectively) and highest in the West region (52.1%, 35.3%, and 28.5%, respectively). Regardless of rural-urban classification and region, no more than 28% of adults met combined aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines. Adults in the most rural category were significantly less likely to meet aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined guidelines than were adults in each of the three other categories (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] range = 0.68–0.89). In addition, adults in medium and small metropolitan counties were less likely to meet guidelines than were adults in the two most urban categories (aOR range = 0.85–0.89). Adults in the Northeast, Midwest, and South U.S. Census Bureau regions were less likely to meet guidelines than were adults in the West region (aOR range = 0.75–0.82). These analyses identify geographic disparities in leisure-time physical activity where focused population-level intervention efforts could help reduce or eliminate the consequent disparities in chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular diseases) and the resulting mortality (5,6).
NHIS is a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults that includes annual multistage cross-sectional household surveys conducted by CDC.§ NHIS 2020 public-use data were analyzed, because changes in the NHIS questionnaire precluded analysis of trend data or combining administration years. NHIS 2020 is also the first year that the NHIS public-use dataset included the four-category rural-urban county classification variable in public-use data. The 2020 sample of 31,568 adults included 21,153 (67%) participants interviewed for the 2020 annual administration and 10,415 (33%) from the 2019 sample who were reinterviewed for longitudinal analyses. Response rates for the 2020 sample were 48.9% (interviewed) and 29.6% (reinterviewed).¶ Among adults in the 2020 sample, information on the indicators of interest was missing for 1,161 (4%) respondents, resulting in a final analytic sample of 30,407.
Three dependent variables were analyzed. First, respondents were classified as either meeting or not meeting the aerobic guideline of ≥150 minutes per week based on self-reported frequency and duration of moderate and vigorous intensity leisure-time aerobic activity.** Second, respondents were classified as either meeting or not meeting the muscle-strengthening guideline of ≥2 days per week based on self-reported frequency of muscle-strengthening activities.†† Finally, respondents were classified as meeting the combined guideline if they met both the aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines.
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to model unadjusted and adjusted predicted population probabilities of dependent variables by rural-urban classification (nonmetropolitan [micropolitan and noncore], medium and small metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, and large central metropolitan [referent]) and U.S. Census Bureau region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West [referent]),§§ while controlling for biologic sex, age, race and ethnicity, education, and income-to-poverty threshold.¶¶ In addition, least-squares mean estimates were used to calculate the predicted population margin effects to compare within categories of the primary predictors (rurality and region). All analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) with parameters adjusted for population weights, clusters, and stratification following NHIS analytic guidelines. These analyses were not subject to Institutional Review Board approval because deidentified public-use data were analyzed. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***
Prevalence rates are 31.9%-72.3% higher in the most active counties by rural-urban classification and 20.3%-29.5% higher in the West than in the South U.S. Census Bureau region (Table 1). The lowest prevalence of meeting the aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined guidelines was observed among adults living in the most rural counties (nonmetropolitan; 38.2%, 21.1%, and 16.1%, respectively) and in the South U.S. Census Bureau region (43.3%, 29.0%, and 22.0%, respectively). Residents of medium and small metropolitan counties and nonmetropolitan counties were significantly less likely to meet aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined guidelines than were residents of large central metropolitan counties (aOR = 0.68–0.89). Compared with residents of the West U.S. Census Bureau region, those in all other U.S. Census Bureau regions were significantly less likely to meet aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined guidelines (aOR range = 0.75–0.82).
In addition, least-squares mean estimates indicate that residents of nonmetropolitan counties were less likely to meet aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined guidelines than were residents of medium and small metropolitan counties (aOR range = 0.78–0.89) and large fringe metropolitan counties (aOR range = 0.72–0.78) (Table 2). Residents of medium and small metropolitan counties were less likely than were residents of large fringe metropolitan counties to meet aerobic (aOR = 0.88) and combined guidelines (aOR = 0.86). Residents in the Northeast, Midwest, and South regions did not differ from one another in likelihood of meeting guidelines (aOR range = 0.99–1.07).

Discussion
In 2020, the prevalence of meeting aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and combined physical activity guidelines in leisure time was lower among adults in nonmetropolitan versus metropolitan counties and higher in the West U.S. Census Bureau region than all other regions, suggesting persistent disparities in this important health behavior (2–4). In addition, because of the more detailed categorization within metropolitan (urban) counties, these analyses also identified differences in prevalence of meeting guidelines between more and less populated metropolitan counties. However, across all geographic and rural-urban categories, adherence to guidelines was low, with no more than 52% of adults meeting aerobic guidelines, 35% meeting muscle strengthening, and 28% meeting combined guidelines.
National efforts such as CDC’s Active People, Healthy Nation††† and Healthy People 2030§§§ require ongoing, detailed surveillance to understand geographic disparities in meeting guidelines. Additional stratification by age, race and ethnicity, sex, income, and other characteristics (7) are important subsequent analyses needed to improve understanding of disparities and inform interventions to eliminate those disparities. Furthermore, physical activity prevalence data for narrower geographic areas (e.g., county and city) could provide evidence to guide local efforts to promote physical activity and ameliorate disparities. Ideally, these data would include the entire spectrum of physical activity intensities (i.e., sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous) and purposes (i.e., leisure, occupational, transportation, and household).
Collective efforts to increase population-level physical activity in rural areas and small towns could benefit from using a conceptual framework to measure performance of the public health system as proposed by Illinois researchers in 2001 (8). This framework suggests that the successful implementation of services and achievement of population-level outcomes are a function of structural capacity of the public health system, which is constrained by the availability and use of human, informational, organizational, physical, and fiscal resources. Suggestions for increasing structural capacity for physical activity promotion in rural areas and small towns include enhancement of human and informational resources for rural physical activity programming. One approach to this is to develop practice-based evidence of novel partners (e.g., public librarians, barbers and hair stylists, and community health workers) who are successfully engaging in physical activity programming in rural areas and small towns, and then disseminate best practices tailored to these professionals in other areas of similar rurality and population size. A second approach includes providing professional development opportunities to established partners (e.g., health departments and Cooperative Extension) regarding current evidence-based practices for rural physical activity promotion. Such efforts to increase the number and variety of entities engaged in physical activity promotion could facilitate enhancement of organizational resources and advance the national, state, and local physical activity planning efforts that engage multisector coalitions (9). In addition, physical resources (i.e., the built environment) could be enhanced by translating evidence from research to inform community health improvement programming, abandoned mine land and brownfield remediation (i.e., removing or sealing points of contamination within a property so that it can be used without health concerns), and rural economic development to focus on physical activity–supportive built environment change.¶¶¶ Public, private, and philanthropic investments are necessary to support each of the other resources and build capacity in the system. Supporting local, state, and national research and practice networks, coalitions, and initiatives focused on population-level physical activity change in rural areas where physical activity prevalence is the lowest could help achieve the Active People, Healthy Nation goal of helping 27 million U.S. persons become more physically active by 2027.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, NHIS data collection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic response, which has affected health behaviors such as physical activity (10). Second, self-reported physical activity is prone to recall bias and overestimation. Finally, lack of assessment of physical activity in other domains such as transportation, occupation, and household precluded the assessment of total physical activity.
This body of epidemiologic evidence is important for understanding rural-urban disparities in physical activity and tracking the attainment of national objectives; however, it is only the first step. A national paradigm shift is needed to build structural capacity through investments in human, informational, organizational, fiscal, and physical resources (8) and to implement policy, systems, and environment changes to impact population level physical activity across the United States, and especially outside of large metropolitan areas.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In January 2003, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was launched. In April 2004, Uganda became the first country to provide PEPFAR-supported antiretroviral therapy (ART).
What is added by this report?
During 2004–2022, the number of persons with HIV infection receiving PEPFAR-supported ART increased by almost 5,000%, to more than 1.3 million, averting nearly 500,000 HIV infections, including more than 230,000 among HIV-exposed infants, and approximately 600,000 HIV-related deaths.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Going forward, efforts will focus on identifying all persons with HIV infection and linking them to effective ART. PEPFAR remains committed to continued strong partnership with the Government of Uganda and other stakeholders toward ending the global AIDS epidemic by 2030 and safeguarding the long-term impact.

On January 28, 2003, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, was announced.* In April 2004, the first person in the world to receive PEPFAR-supported antiretroviral therapy (ART) was a man aged 34 years in Uganda. Effective ART reduces morbidity and mortality among persons with HIV infection (1) and prevents both mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) (2) and sexual transmission once viral load is suppressed to undetectable levels (<200 viral copies/mL) (3). By September 2022, more than 1.3 million persons with HIV infection in Uganda were receiving PEPFAR-supported ART, an increase of approximately 5,000% from September 2004. As indicators of the ART program’s effectiveness, a proxy MTCT rate decreased 77%, from 6.4% in 2010 to 1.5% in 2022, and the viral load suppression rate (<1,000 viral copies/mL) increased 3%, from 91% in 2016 to 94% in September 2022. During 2004–2022, ART scale-up helped avert nearly 500,000 HIV infections, including more than 230,000 infections among HIV-exposed infants, and approximately 600,000 HIV-related deaths. Going forward, efforts will focus on identifying all persons with HIV infection and rapidly linking them to effective ART. PEPFAR remains committed to continued strong partnership with the Government of Uganda, civil society, and other development partners toward sustainable solutions aligned with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) fast-track strategy to ending the global AIDS epidemic by 2030† and safeguarding impact achieved in the long term.
Local cases of AIDS were first recognized in Uganda in the early 1980s (4). In October 1986, the Uganda AIDS Control Program (ACP) was established within the Ministry of Health, initially focused on HIV prevention and palliative care, because of the lack of treatment options at the time (5). HIV prevalence started to decline in the early 1990s, linked to reductions in casual sex and increased protective sexual behavior (e.g., condom use) (6,7). In 2002, ACP established a national HIV MTCT prevention program (8), after the HIVNET 012 trial, which was conducted in Uganda and found that nevirapine could prevent MTCT (9).
In April 2004, Uganda was the first country in the world to provide PEPFAR-supported ART. Since then, ART eligibility criteria have expanded from an initial focus on patients with advanced disease (e.g., CD4 count <200 cells/μL). In 2012, “Option B+” expanded ART eligibility to all pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV infection (8), and in 2015, “Treat All” expanded ART eligibility to all persons with HIV infection regardless of disease severity or other criteria.§ In 2018, Uganda introduced dolutegravir-based regimens (e.g., tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir [TLD]), with the goal of improving ART effectiveness.¶ Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected medical services, including the HIV program; for example, movement restrictions limited patients’ ability to attend clinics for appointments and ART refills (10). In addition to clinical services and commodity procurement, PEPFAR has also supported health system–strengthening activities, including workforce capacity building and support to health workers; leadership and governance capacity building; development of financing, information, laboratory, and supply chain systems; and integration of HIV services into the general health system.** PEPFAR Uganda has worked in collaboration with other stakeholders, including UNAIDS and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, to ensure optimized resource utilization in support of the Government of Uganda. By 2021, UNAIDS estimated that there were 1.4 million (range = 1.3–1.6 million) persons with HIV infection in Uganda, with an estimated 54,000 (range = 43,000–69,000) new infections occurring annually.††
To describe the scale-up of PEPFAR-supported ART, PEPFAR Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting and archival programmatic data§§ were analyzed by fiscal year (October–September); data permitting comparison by sex and age group (adults [persons aged ≥15 years] and children and adolescents [persons aged <15 years]) have been available since 2005. Before October 2018, persons with HIV infection on ART were defined as clients at a PEPFAR-supported site if ≤90 days had elapsed since their last appointment; in October 2018, this definition changed to ≤28 days since the last appointment. The proxy MTCT rate was calculated as the number of HIV-exposed infants during pregnancy or the breastfeeding period (i.e., 18 months postpartum) who had a positive HIV test result among those who received testing (data available for 2010–2022). Viral load suppression was defined as <1,000 HIV viral copies/mL, and the suppression rate was calculated as the number of persons with HIV infection with viral load suppression among those who had received a viral load test (data available for 2016–2022). The 2021 UNAIDS Spectrum AIDS Impact Model (AIM) and Goals ASM models were used to estimate the number of infections averted, including among HIV-exposed infants, and HIV-related deaths averted by mid-year (July–June). Both models use national program statistics, survey and surveillance data, and study-derived epidemiologic parameters to calibrate structured models of HIV transmission and produce indicators such as incidence and mortality.¶¶ To estimate the number of infections and deaths averted in the absence of PEPFAR, the number of persons with HIV infection on ART were interpolated using program data from 2003 when an estimated 2% of persons with HIV infection were on ART, with 2% of the program numbers for 2021; the number of women reached by the MTCT prevention program was held constant from 2003 levels. Data from the electronic medical records for the first person to receive PEPFAR-supported ART were abstracted from the clinic where he first received ART and from the clinic where he last received ART. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***
During September 30, 2004–September 30, 2022, the number of persons with HIV infection on PEPFAR-supported ART increased 4,884%, from 26,365 to 1,313,952 (Figure 1). During September 30, 2005–September 30, 2022, the number of adults with HIV infection receiving PEPFAR-supported ART increased 2,687%, from 45,061 to 1,255,983, and the number of children with HIV infection on PEPFAR-supported ART increased 1,167%, from 4,577 to 57,969. The number of women and men with HIV infection on PEPFAR-supported ART increased 3,723%, from 28,836 to 853,103, and 2,115%, from 20,802 to 460,849, respectively.
The proxy MTCT rate declined from 6.4% (2,327 HIV-positive infants exposed during pregnancy or 18 months postpartum among 36,119 tested) in 2010 to 1.5% (1,060 of 71,265) in 2022 (Figure 2). During 2016–2022, the number of viral load tests conducted increased 130%, from 526,936 to 1,213,707, and the viral load suppression rate increased from 91% (479,915 of 526,936) to 94% (1,145,839 of 1,213,707) (Figure 2). In September 2022, viral load suppression rates were higher among adults (95% [1,116,888 of 1,179,551]) than among children (85% [28,951 of 34,156]), and slightly higher among women (95% [757,248 of 797,462]) than among men (93% [388,591 of 416,245]).
During 2004–2022, an estimated 491,345 HIV infections were averted, including 231,833 among HIV-exposed infants. Annually, a median of 21,408 HIV infections were averted, ranging from 913 in 2004 to 57,171 in 2022 (Figure 3). During this period, an estimated 586,074 deaths were averted, ranging from 1,138 in 2004 to 48,348 deaths in 2022 (annual median = 32,179).

Case Report
In February 2004, a Ugandan man aged 34 years received a diagnosis of HIV infection. The results of a CD4 test conducted in March was 1 cell/μL. In April, he became the first person in the world to receive PEPFAR-supported ART, receiving stavudine-lamivudine-nevirapine (D4T-3TC-NVP). In May 2020, he received a course of tuberculosis preventive therapy, which he completed in November 2020. Since March 2021, he has not received a diagnosis of active tuberculosis disease or an HIV-related opportunistic infection. In January 2021, he was transitioned to TLD, and as of September 2022, he receives 4-month multimonth dispensing. His most recent viral load test conducted in March 2022 indicated viral load suppression. As a result, he was eligible for and enrolled in a fast-track drug refill program.

Discussion
Twenty years after the announcement of PEPFAR, the program’s first patient is now aged 53 years and remains on PEPFAR-supported ART with suppressed viral load. Sustained efforts substantially expanded ART in Uganda (4,884% increase), and as of September 2022, more than 1.3 million persons with HIV infection were receiving PEPFAR-supported ART. During 2020–2022, HIV services adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic (10), with an increased number of persons with HIV infection on PEPFAR-supported ART (98,012) and increased viral load suppression rates. Treatment is effective, as indicated by increased viral load suppression rates, especially after the introduction of dolutegravir-based ART; and since 2004, ART scale-up averted approximately 600,000 HIV-related deaths. Treatment is also prevention, as indicated by decreased MTCT rates, and since 2004, ART scale-up has contributed to averting nearly 500,000 estimated infections, including more than 230,000 estimated infections among HIV-exposed infants.
Despite tremendous gains, persons with HIV infection currently not on ART and those without viral load suppression are at risk for poor clinical outcomes and can transmit HIV, potentially leading to new infections. Among adults, viral load suppression rates have increased to 95%. Rates among men are slightly lower than those among women, and additional efforts are needed to ensure that children receive individually optimized ART, given that viral load suppression rates remain <90% among children. Observed differences in viral load suppression rates derived from program data are substantiated by the 2020–2021 Uganda Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (UPHIA), a nationally representative survey among adults.††† Although MTCT rates have declined, infants continue to be born with or acquire HIV during their first months of life, leading to a lifelong need for ART. The 2020–2021 UPHIA also found that 80.9% of persons with HIV infection knew their status, and 96.1% who knew their status were on ART, indicating linkage to treatment is high, although more efforts are needed to improve case finding.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, indicator definitions and the systems to report data have evolved over time, which might have affected data quality despite continual PEPFAR and national data quality assurance activities. Second, persons with HIV infection can access health services at any site, regardless of residence; therefore, some persons might have been counted more than once. This limitation also prevented direct assessment of ART coverage. Third, the proxy MTCT rate could be an underestimate because HIV-exposed infants who did not have testing were not included. Fourth, the model estimated averted HIV infections and HIV-related deaths based on ART; however, other services (e.g., voluntary medical male circumcision) and contextual factors beyond ART scale up might have contributed. In addition, estimates of the number of infections averted could have been underestimated. Finally, it is not possible to quantify the contribution from PEPFAR and other stakeholders (e.g., UNAIDS and the Global Fund) in support of the Government of Uganda to scale up ART, because investments in infrastructure, leadership, and financing (including commodities) have worked synergistically with PEPFAR investments and programming.
During 2004–2022, PEPFAR supported the scale up of ART (4,884% increase), which averted nearly 600,000 HIV-related deaths and 500,000 infections, including 230,000 infections among HIV-exposed infants. Going forward, efforts will focus on identifying all persons with HIV infection, and rapidly linking them to effective ART. PEPFAR remains committed to continued strong partnership with the Government of Uganda, civil society, and development partners toward sustainable solutions aligned with the UNAIDS fast-track strategy to ending the global AIDS epidemic by 2030 and safeguarding impact in the long term.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
COVID-19 vaccines are effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing home residents; however, the impact of recently recommended vaccinations, including bivalent booster doses, in this population is unknown.
What is added by this report?
Nursing home residents who were not up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines had a 30%–50% higher risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with residents who were up to date with COVID-19 vaccines.
What are the implications for public health practice?
This study supports other recent findings that the bivalent booster dose offers additional protection in persons who previously received monovalent vaccines. Nursing home residents can maximize protection against COVID-19 by receiving bivalent COVID-19 booster doses to stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations.

Nursing home residents have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19; older age, comorbidities, and the congregate nature of nursing homes place residents at higher risk for infection and severe COVID-19–associated outcomes, including death (1). Studies have demonstrated that receipt of a primary COVID-19 mRNA vaccination series (2) and monovalent booster doses (3) is effective in reducing COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality in this population. Public health recommendations for staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination have been revised throughout the pandemic response, most recently to include an updated (bivalent) booster dose, which protects against both the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 and recent Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 (4). However, data on the effectiveness of staying up to date, including with bivalent booster doses, are lacking among nursing home residents. CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) analyzed surveillance data to examine weekly incidence rates of COVID-19 among nursing home residents by up-to-date vaccination status (receipt of a bivalent booster dose or completion of a primary series or receipt of a monovalent booster dose within the previous 2 months [i.e., not yet eligible to receive a bivalent booster dose]).* Up-to-date vaccination status among nursing home residents remained low throughout the study period, increasing to 48.9% by the week ending January 8, 2023. During October 10, 2022–January 8, 2023, the COVID-19 weekly incidence rates (new cases per 1,000 nursing home residents) among residents who were not up to date with COVID-19 vaccination were consistently higher than those among residents who were up to date. Moreover, the weekly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) indicated that residents who were not up to date with COVID-19 vaccines had a higher risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 than their up-to-date counterparts (IRR range = 1.3–1.5). It is critical that nursing home residents stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines and receive a bivalent booster dose to maximize protection against COVID-19.
Nursing homes began reporting numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (a newly positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test result received by a resident) and vaccination data to NHSN in April 2020 and December 2020, respectively, and federal mandates issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) require CMS-certified nursing homes to report these data weekly.†,§ The method for collecting laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case data in nursing homes has been described (2). Vaccination data collection includes the weekly number of residents in the nursing home (with a stay of ≥24 hours) stratified by vaccination status, including the number of residents who are up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination.
NHSN analyzed weekly COVID-19 case and vaccination status data during October 10, 2022–January 8, 2023, for CMS-certified nursing homes to assess the data collected based on NHSN’s 2022 fourth quarter (October–December) definition of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status.¶ The study paired weekly incident case counts by vaccination status with weekly resident counts by vaccination status for each nursing home to calculate crude COVID-19 incidence rates with 95% CIs, by up-to-date vaccination status for each reporting week. Case counts were combined with resident vaccination counts from 2 weeks earlier, because COVID-19 case vaccination status is classified according to vaccination status 14 days before receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.
Facilities with missing case or vaccination data were excluded from the analysis. NHSN calculated IRRs by up-to-date vaccination status each week. NHSN also analyzed a subset of data from facilities voluntarily reporting dates, types, and number of primary series doses and booster doses received by each resident (rather than weekly aggregate totals) to calculate the proportion of up-to-date residents who had received a bivalent booster dose.** Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††
Among 16,352 nursing homes, 15,049 (92%) in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia reported case and vaccination data for ≥1 week during the 13-week study period.§§ After exclusions, 192,289 facility-weeks (97%) were included in the analysis. An average of 14,791 facilities reported both COVID-19 vaccination and case data each week (range = 14,622–14,874). Facility size (the number of health care personnel per facility) varied, with a median of 116 health care personnel per facility (IQR = 82–165) (Figure). The percentage of residents with up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status increased slightly during the study period, beginning the week of October 23, from 37.5% to 48.9%; this incremental increase was similar across all facility sizes and geographic regions.
Each week, COVID-19 incidence rates among nursing home residents who were not up to date with COVID-19 vaccination were higher than those among residents who were up to date (Table). Incidence rates among residents who were up to date with COVID-19 vaccination ranged from 7.2 per 1,000 residents (week ending November 13, 2022) to 15.6 (week ending January 8, 2023) during this period, while incidence rates among those who were not up to date ranged from 9.5 (week ending October 16, 2022) to 18.8 (weeks ending December 11, 2022, and January 8, 2023). IRRs between residents who were not up to date with COVID-19 vaccination and those who were up to date were statistically significant and ranged from 1.3 to 1.5. Among the 15,049 nursing homes included in this study, 1,759 (11.7%) voluntarily reported additional details on vaccine doses for each resident rather than weekly aggregate totals. Analysis of these data for each week of the study period indicated that >99% of residents classified as being up to date had received a bivalent booster dose.

Discussion
Weekly incidence rates of COVID-19 among nursing home residents who were not up to date with COVID-19 vaccines were 30%–50% higher than were those among residents who were up to date during October 10, 2022–January 8, 2023. Among the subset of nursing homes reporting additional details on vaccine doses for each resident, almost all residents with up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status had received a bivalent booster dose, suggesting that up-to-date vaccination status can be used to represent bivalent booster dose coverage among nursing home residents. The findings in this report are consistent with other recent studies supporting effectiveness of bivalent booster doses, including a study among adults aged ≥18 years demonstrating that bivalent booster doses maximized protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with protection from monovalent vaccination alone (5). Another recent study found that bivalent booster doses produced a robust immunologic response in nursing home residents (6). Bivalent booster doses have also been shown to provide additional protection against severe outcomes associated with COVID-19, compared with monovalent vaccination alone, including protection against COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care visits among adults aged ≥18 years and protection against COVID-19 hospitalization among adults aged ≥65 years (7,8). Public health efforts to sustain up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination status among nursing home residents (including recommended vaccinations and booster doses) are critical to protecting this population.
Although bivalent booster doses were recommended during fall 2022 (4), and the time to receive the bivalent booster dose and remain up to date according to current recommendations has been limited, the proportion of nursing home residents in this study who were up to date (48.9%) was lower than the percentage of nursing home residents who completed a primary series (86.1%) and who received monovalent booster doses (87.0%).¶¶ Bivalent booster doses are recommended for nursing home residents who previously received monovalent doses to stay up to date. There might be several reasons that nursing home residents have not received a bivalent COVID-19 booster dose, including the perception that additional vaccination is unnecessary because of beliefs of low booster vaccine effectiveness, misinformation about the severity of illness, or vaccination fatigue related to changes in guidance and recommendations for more doses (9,10). Access to vaccination at the facility might also have an impact.
The findings in this study are subject to at least four limitations. First, data are largely manually reported by nursing homes; therefore, misclassification of case and vaccination status of residents is possible, especially in light of changing guidance regarding what constitutes being up to date. Second, crude incidence rates and IRRs in this analysis do not account for potential nursing home or person-level confounding factors, such as time since vaccination, previous infection, age, comorbidities, community transmission rates, nursing home staff member vaccination coverage rates, or nursing home infection prevention practices. Third, the analysis did not consider residents who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result to be up to date with COVID-19 vaccines until 14 days after receipt of their last vaccine dose; therefore, cases among residents not up to date with COVID-19 vaccines might include infections among residents who had received a recent bivalent vaccine dose <14 days earlier. This would bias findings of difference between the two groups toward the null. Finally, the group that was not up to date comprised both unvaccinated residents and those who had received some previous vaccination but were not up to date. This precluded comparison of more specific vaccination statuses (e.g., completely unvaccinated, receipt of a complete primary series, and completed a primary series plus ≥1 monovalent booster dose) with the up-to-date group.
In this study of U.S. nursing home residents during October 2022–January 2023, differences in crude COVID-19 incidence rates among persons who were up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations and those who were not suggest that staying up to date with CDC-recommended vaccinations, which now includes receiving a bivalent booster dose, maximizes protection against COVID-19. Efforts to address barriers and increase bivalent COVID-19 booster dose coverage among nursing home residents are critical to preventing illness, severe disease, and death in this population.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Previous COVID-19 monovalent vaccines provided substantial reductions in COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality among nursing home residents; however, only one half of these residents and one quarter of nursing home staff members have received the COVID-19 bivalent booster dose to date.
What is added by this report?
Among nursing home residents in two states, SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels waned within months after vaccination, irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, after monovalent booster vaccination. Antibody response broadened after the COVID-19 bivalent booster for vaccinated nursing home residents among those with and without previous infection.
What are the implications for public health practice?
All eligible nursing home residents and staff members should follow current recommendations to receive a bivalent COVID-19 booster dose to reduce their risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19–associated illness, and death.

Introduction of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in late 2020 helped to mitigate disproportionate COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality in U.S. nursing homes (1); however, reduced effectiveness of monovalent vaccines during the period of Omicron variant predominance led to recommendations for booster doses with bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that include an Omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike protein component to broaden immune response and improve vaccine effectiveness against circulating Omicron variants (2). Recent studies suggest that bivalent booster doses provide substantial additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19–associated disease among immunocompetent adults who previously received only monovalent vaccines (3).* The immunologic response after receipt of bivalent boosters among nursing home residents, who often mount poor immunologic responses to vaccines, remains unknown. Serial testing of anti-spike protein antibody binding and neutralizing antibody titers in serum collected from 233 long-stay nursing home residents from the time of their primary vaccination series and including any subsequent booster doses, including the bivalent vaccine, was performed. The bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine substantially increased anti-spike and neutralizing antibody titers against Omicron sublineages, including BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5, irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or previous receipt of 1 or 2 booster doses. These data, in combination with evidence of low uptake of bivalent booster vaccination among residents and staff members in nursing homes (4), support the recommendation that nursing home residents and staff members receive a bivalent COVID-19 booster dose to reduce associated morbidity and mortality (2).
The current extended ongoing study (5,6) follows 233 volunteer residents of 28 community nursing homes and veterans homes across two states. The median volunteer age was 74 years (IQR = 67–85 years), 53% were female, 79% were non-Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) White, 19% were non-Hispanic Black or African American, and 1% were of Hispanic ethnicity. Participants had received their primary mRNA vaccination series by February 2021 and the first booster dose within 9 months after completing the primary series; 78% of participants received a second monovalent booster dose within 9 months of the first booster dose. All participants received the bivalent booster during September–November 2022 after its emergency use authorization.
Serum testing occurred a median of 17 days (IQR = 12–25 days) after receipt of all booster doses. Intermediate blood draws occurred 3 months after the monovalent booster among the group that received 2 booster doses and 11 months after the monovalent booster dose among those who had received only 1 booster dose. All participants or their legally authorized representatives provided informed consent approved by Western Institutional Review Board — Copernicus Group.†
Approximately three quarters of participants (77%) had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction or antigen test or based on increases in SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels that could not be explained by vaccination.§ Using these methods, the analysis excluded persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection between receipt of their last booster dose and the bivalent booster dose to reduce confounding related to discriminating between antibody increases from infection versus vaccination.
Anti-spike binding antibodies were assessed using a bead-multiplex immunoassay using Wuhan, Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5 strains (5); neutralizing activity was also assessed using a pseudovirus neutralization assay¶ with spike protein based on the ancestral Wuhan and Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5 strains (5).
Study participants were stratified by the number of booster doses received before the bivalent booster dose. Within these groups, the geometric mean titers of anti-spike and neutralizing antibodies were measured at three timepoints 1) 2 weeks after the last booster dose, 2) at the most recent blood draw before receiving the bivalent booster dose, and 3) 2 weeks after receipt of the bivalent booster dose. Distributions of values were categorized by timepoint, assay, strain, and 1 versus 2 previous booster doses. To compare values over time given repeated measures within the same subject, a mixed-effects model predicting log-transformed titers was estimated for each subgroup with random intercepts for study subjects. Model-estimated means across the three timepoints were tested. A Bonferroni adjustment was imposed across all the tests performed. In addition, response to the bivalent dose was analyzed using ordinary least squares regression on log-transformed titers assessing effects of 1) previous infection, 2) a second monovalent booster dose before receipt of the bivalent booster dose, and 3) the interaction of the two effects. In the absence of a detected interaction, the model was estimated without the interaction to summarize main effects of previous infection and number of previous booster doses. All analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.2; R Foundation) and used functions from the linear and nonlinear mixed effects package.
Titers of anti-spike antibody against Wuhan, BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5 and neutralizing antibodies against Wuhan and BA.1 had declined considerably before administration of the bivalent booster dose (Table) (Figure 1) (Figure 2). This decline was statistically significant in mixed-effects models (adjusted p-value <0.05), except in BA.5 neutralization for those with only 1 previous monovalent booster dose (p = 0.105). Receipt of a bivalent booster dose produced substantial increases in model-estimated neutralizing and anti-spike antibody titers to the ancestral strain and Omicron variants compared with those at the intermediate timepoint between receipt of the previous and the bivalent boosters (all p-values <0.001), restoring immunity after waning vaccine- or infection-induced immunity. The bivalent booster also substantially elevated neutralizing antibody titers against the Wuhan, BA.1, and BA.4/BA.5 strains to levels above those achieved 2 weeks after receipt of the most recent booster dose among persons who had received 1 or 2 monovalent mRNA booster doses (p-value range = 0.035–<0.001). These results suggest that neutralizing capacity of antibodies against Omicron strains achieved after receipt of the bivalent booster dose was higher than that for previous monovalent vaccines. In contrast, anti-spike titers against BA.1 and Wuhan strains increased among all participants after receipt of the bivalent booster dose but did not exceed those achieved after the previous monovalent booster dose (Table) (Figure 2). The trend (p = 0.062) suggests that the anti-spike BA.5 titer was higher after the bivalent booster than after only one monovalent booster. No interaction effect of previous infection status and number of booster doses in response to the bivalent vaccine was detected. Receipt of 1 or 2 previous booster doses only substantially affected the anti-spike BA.1 response, where higher anti-spike responses were observed among persons who had received 2 monovalent booster doses than among those who had received only 1 dose.

Discussion
These data show that nursing home residents who received a bivalent COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine dose mounted substantial antibody titers to the Wuhan and Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5 variants, irrespective of previous infection or previous receipt of 1 or 2 monovalent booster doses. These findings provide immunologic evidence that the bivalent booster vaccine confers additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents who have previously received only monovalent vaccine.
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nursing home population experienced a particularly high case fatality rate (1). After national deployment of mRNA vaccines in late 2020, >80% of nursing home residents had completed the primary vaccination series by July 2021, and incidence of COVID-19 and COVID-19–related deaths were subsequently markedly reduced (7). After the more recent vaccination recommendations, booster dose coverage has been lower than that initially seen with the primary series, although booster dose coverage among nursing home residents has been higher than that among the general population (7). One large study of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years reported that high initial vaccine effectiveness against unplanned care waned across age groups but was more pronounced among immunocompromised persons; no data on vaccine effectiveness among nursing home residents were reported (8). A recent study showed that nursing home residents receiving the second COVID-19 monovalent booster dose were protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death during the Omicron period, demonstrating the effectiveness of the monovalent booster among this population during the 60-day follow-up period (9). Although serologic studies were not performed in that study, effectiveness of the monovalent COVID-19 booster against the Omicron variant was presumably associated with cross-neutralizing antibody titers generated against both the ancestral Wuhan strain and newer Omicron variants. Similarly, neutralizing antibody titers against the Wuhan, BA.1, and BA.4/BA.5 strains in the present cohort of nursing home residents were higher after the bivalent booster than after the most recent previous monovalent booster, suggesting that the bivalent booster increases and broadens the immune response among nursing home residents.
Data from CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network show that as of January 8, 2023, one half (50%) of nursing home residents and less than one quarter (22%) of nursing home staff members had received the bivalent booster dose (4), highlighting an opportunity to intensify efforts to increase bivalent booster dose coverage among these persons according to current recommendations to reduce the occurrence of severe COVID-19–associated illness, hospitalization, and death. Other studies have demonstrated that antibody levels among nursing home health care workers also markedly increased after booster vaccination (5,10), reinforcing the recommendation that all eligible nursing home staff members should receive a bivalent booster dose. Furthermore, high staff member vaccination uptake improves outcomes among the residents for whom they care.**
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, immunologic findings might not directly translate into real-world reduction in COVID-19 severity. Although binding and neutralizing antibody levels are correlated with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection at the population level, the absence of precise individual indicators of protection limits interpretability of these data. Second, certain vaccinated participants might have had undetected asymptomatic infection or not have been identified for categorization as having had a previous infection under the laboratory criteria used in this study. This limitation could result in mistakenly attributing the observed immunologic responses to the booster dose rather than the actual recent infection. Third, sample size was relatively limited, with more men included than among the typical nursing home population, primarily resulting from recruitment from two veterans homes with predominantly male populations. However, no substantial difference in immune responses between men and women among the nursing home population has been noted in previous studies (5,6). Fourth, certain subjects had missing timepoints related to exclusion for recent infection among vaccinated persons, recent enrollment of some participants, unavailability of blood draws at serial timepoints, or incomplete laboratory data. Despite these limitations, this study had adequate power to demonstrate that the bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine booster dose substantially increased anti-spike and neutralizing titers against Omicron sublineages among nursing home residents, supporting current bivalent booster vaccine recommendations.
These findings indicate that nursing home residents can benefit from bivalent booster vaccination, substantially broadening their immune response to tested Omicron variants. Along with nursing home staff members, nursing home residents should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including receipt of a bivalent booster dose if ≥2 months have elapsed since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose (either a primary series or original monovalent booster) to reduce their risk for infection, severe disease, and death.††

In 2021, among adults aged ≥18 years, women were more likely to have arthritis than were men (21.0% versus 16.2%). This pattern was consistent among non-Hispanic White (White) (22.2% versus 17.7%), non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (24.6% versus 13.9%), and Hispanic or Latino (17.7% versus 12.4%) adults. Among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) adults, the higher rate of arthritis among women compared with men (11.8% versus 10.1%) was not statistically significant. Among women, Asian adults were least likely to have arthritis, whereas among men, Asian adults were less likely than White or Black adults to have arthritis.

Influenza seasons typically begin in October and peak between December and February (1); however, the 2022–23 influenza season in Tennessee began in late September and was characterized by high pediatric hospitalization rates during November. This report describes a field investigation conducted in Tennessee during November 2022, following reports of increasing influenza hospitalizations. Data from surveillance networks, patient surveys, and whole genome sequencing of influenza virus specimens were analyzed to assess influenza activity and secondary illness risk. Influenza activity increased earlier than usual among all age groups, and rates of influenza-associated hospitalization among children were high in November, reaching 12.6 per 100,000 in children aged <5 years, comparable to peak levels typically seen in high-severity seasons. Circulating influenza viruses were genetically similar to vaccine components. Among persons who received testing for influenza at outpatient clinics, children were twice as likely to receive a positive influenza test result as were adults. Among household contacts exposed to someone with influenza, children were more than twice as likely to become ill compared with adults. As the influenza season continues, it is important for all persons, especially those at higher risk for severe disease, to protect themselves from influenza. To prevent influenza and severe influenza complications, all persons aged ≥6 months should get vaccinated, avoid contact with ill persons, and take influenza antivirals if recommended and prescribed.*
The field investigation was conducted in November 2022 to understand early influenza activity in 14 of 95 Tennessee counties clustered in middle Tennessee and to identify groups most affected.† Weekly, age group–stratified data on emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI-ED) and influenza-associated hospitalizations were obtained from the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) and FluSurv-NET surveillance systems,§ respectively, and were compared with data from previous influenza seasons.¶ For influenza-associated hospitalizations, a probability distribution constructed from the three highest weekly rates from each previous season (2) was used to define age group–specific intensity thresholds for the 50th (medium), 90th (high), and 98th (very high) percentiles. Hospitalization data from previous seasons were adjusted for underdetection using data on age group–specific testing practices; 2022–23 season data were not adjusted. All surveillance data were restricted to October 2, 2022–January 7, 2023, reported as of January 12, 2023.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the Mid-Cumberland Regional Health Department clinics provided the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) with information about persons who received testing for influenza. These data were merged with influenza vaccination records for the current season obtained from the Tennessee Immunization Information System. Persons who received a positive or negative influenza test result during November 4–18, 2022, were invited to complete a survey asking about their illness, which was facilitated by REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at TDH** (3,4). Those who received a positive influenza test result were invited to complete a second, follow-up survey 1 week after their test to inquire about illnesses in household contacts.†† VUMC clinics provided influenza-positive specimens collected during November 4–18 to CDC for whole genome sequencing to characterize circulating influenza viruses.
Factors associated with positive influenza test results in patients who received testing at participating clinics were identified using logistic regression. Characteristics of household contacts were compared using logistic regression accounting for household clustering. Secondary attack rates for symptomatic illness among household contacts with adjustment for age, vaccination status, and household size were assessed with a chain binomial model, assuming a 2-day infectiousness period, beginning at symptom onset, and a 2-day incubation period (5). Descriptive and regression analysis of outpatient data was conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute), and the chain binomial modeling was conducted in C. This activity was reviewed by CDC, TDH, and VUMC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§
During October 2, 2022–January 7, 2023, ILI-ED visits and influenza-associated hospitalization rates began increasing and reached high levels earlier than in recent influenza seasons. These trends were most evident among persons aged <18 years, with ILI-ED visits in this group accounting for 31% of all visits during the week ending November 26, 2022 (previous seasons’ peak levels range = 14%–34%). Weekly pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations reached 12.6 per 100,000 children aged <5 years and 6.9 per 100,000 persons aged <18 years, exceeding the 90th percentile (high intensity) and approaching the 98th percentile (very high intensity) of peak weekly rates for children reported during previous influenza seasons (Figure). In comparison, among persons of all ages, ILI-ED reached 15% of all visits (previous seasons’ peak range = 5%–13%), and influenza-associated hospitalizations surpassed medium intensity.
Among 4,626 persons from participating outpatient clinics who received influenza testing during November 4–18, 2022, a total of 2,164 (47%) were children, who were more likely to receive a positive test result (33%; 714 of 2,164) than were adults (20%; 483 of 2,462) (p<0.001). Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was low in both children (23%; 499 of 2,164) and adults (34%; 830 of 2,462) who were tested for influenza. Among 332 specimens with completed sequencing data, 179 (54%) were classified as A(H3N2)3C.2a1b2a.2, and 153 (46%) as A(H1N1)pdm096B.1A5a.2; all were genetically similar to vaccine components.¶¶ Among 489 persons who responded to the survey (11% of 4,626 patients contacted for the survey), 269 (55%) were reported as children. Among 238 persons surveyed who had a positive influenza test result within 48 hours of symptom onset, 109 (46%) received influenza antiviral medication. Children were less likely to be treated (41%; 63 of 155) than were adults (55%; 46 of 83) (p = 0.03).
One hundred eighty-five persons with influenza completed the follow-up household survey.*** Among their 480 household contacts, 151 (31%) reported having any illness before or after the respondent’s illness, among whom 83 (55%) reported symptoms of fever and either cough or sore throat consistent with influenza-like illness. From a univariate logistic regression model, household contacts reporting any illness were more likely to be children (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.45–2.35) or share a bedroom with an ill person (OR = 2.11; 95% CI = 2.59–2.80) during the week before or after the respondent’s positive influenza test date compared with contacts who were not ill. In the transmission model, children were more likely to become ill than were adults (adjusted OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.55–4.03) (Table). After adjustment for household size and reported vaccination status, the secondary attack rate was 11.9% (range = 6.1%–22.0%) among child contacts and 5.1% (range = 2.7%–9.4%) among adult contacts.

Discussion
Influenza activity in Tennessee during the 2022–23 season began earlier than in previous seasons, and the percentage of outpatient visits for influenza and the rate of influenza-associated hospitalization among children have been high. This investigation found that children seeking outpatient care were more likely to receive a positive influenza test result than were adults, and that pediatric influenza-associated hospitalization rates in late November reached levels similar to peak activity during recent high-severity influenza seasons. Together with the finding that, among household contacts, secondary illnesses occurred more frequently in children than in adults, these results suggest that children are experiencing an increased impact of influenza during the 2022–23 season.
Influenza activity appears to have been declining in Tennessee and nationally since early December 2022; however, influenza continues to circulate and several weeks of the season remain (6). Although anyone can be infected with influenza viruses, young children, older adults, and persons with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for influenza-associated morbidity and mortality (7). Seasonal influenza vaccination remains the best way to protect against influenza and influenza-associated complications, including among children. All persons aged ≥6 months should receive a seasonal influenza vaccine to protect themselves for the remainder of the influenza season. In addition, everyday preventive actions, such as reducing interactions with persons who are ill; avoiding others when ill; avoiding touching one’s mouth, eyes, and nose; frequent handwashing; and wearing facemasks when respiratory virus circulation is high, can help reduce the risk for becoming infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses.
The rates of influenza-associated hospitalization in Tennessee, especially among children, were higher during October–November 2022 than during the same months in recent influenza seasons. The hospitalization rates among children in Tennessee are similar to those seen nationally among children (8). Influenza antiviral medication should be prioritized for hospitalized persons and all patients at increased risk for influenza complications (including children aged <2 years and persons with certain underlying medical conditions); these medications can reduce the risk for influenza-associated complications (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, these findings are limited in generalizability because the population represents a sample from middle Tennessee recruited over a period of 2 weeks in November, and only 11% of invited participants completed the survey. Second, this early season assessment might not be indicative or predictive of the remainder of this influenza season. Third, because Tennessee does not require reporting to the state immunization registry, vaccination status might be underestimated. Fourth, survey participants were recruited from among clinic patients and likely represent a subset of the population with more access to health care services. Finally, the transmission model assumes that ill household contacts had influenza, which might overestimate infection because other respiratory viruses were also circulating.
In Tennessee, the 2022–23 influenza season has been marked by early and intense activity, particularly affecting children, with higher rates of pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations than have been reported in recent influenza seasons. As the influenza season continues, it is important for all persons, especially those at higher risk for severe disease, to protect themselves from influenza. To prevent influenza and severe influenza complications, all persons aged ≥6 months should get vaccinated, avoid contact with ill persons, and take influenza antivirals if recommended and prescribed.

† FluSurv-NET data identifies influenza-associated hospitalizations in eight middle Tennessee counties: Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Robertson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson. The Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) captures emergency department visits statewide; analysis was restricted to the same eight counties. Survey data were collected from two clinic networks in middle Tennessee, including the same eight counties as well as Houston, Humphreys, Maury, Montgomery, Stewart, and Trousdale counties.
§ ESSENCE is a syndromic surveillance system that captures weekly percentages of ED visits with an influenza-specific diagnosis code or chief complaint suggesting influenza-like illness. FluSurv-NET is a population-based surveillance system that identifies weekly rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations within the catchment area.
¶ For ESSENCE data, comparison seasons included 2017–18 through 2019–20 and 2021–22. For FluSurv-NET data, comparison seasons included 2012–13 through 2019–20 and 2021–22. The 2020–21 influenza season was excluded from both comparisons because of minimal influenza activity.
** The survey was provided in the region’s most frequently spoken languages (Arabic, English, or Spanish) and facilitated by REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at TDH with a Twilio application programming interface. Survey participants could access the survey online through a link provided by text message to their mobile telephone. In addition, TDH- and VUMC-affiliated employees called invited participants and offered the survey by telephone.
†† The follow-up survey asked about sex, age, and influenza vaccination status of household members, whether they slept in the same room as an ill person, and whether they were ill the week before or after the participant received influenza testing. If an ill household member was reported, additional questions were asked about onset date and symptoms, including fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, diarrhea, vomiting, and body aches. Responses from participants whose household members had already participated were excluded.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Alcohol screening and brief intervention (ASBI) is an evidence-based tool to reduce alcohol consumption in adults, including pregnant persons.
What is added by this report?
In 2017 and 2019, during their most recent health care visit, 80% of pregnant persons reported being asked about their alcohol use; only 16% of those with past 30-day alcohol consumption were advised by a health care provider to quit or reduce their alcohol use. Disparities in alcohol screening were observed among pregnant persons with lower educational attainment.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Implementation of recommended ASBI among pregnant persons can help prevent alcohol use or reduce current drinking. Strategies to enhance ASBI include integrating screenings into electronic health records, increasing reimbursement for ASBI services, and development of additional tools including electronic ASBI.

Alcohol use during pregnancy is a major preventable cause of adverse alcohol-related outcomes, including birth defects and developmental disabilities.* Alcohol screening and brief intervention (ASBI) is an evidence-based primary care tool that has been shown to prevent or reduce alcohol consumption during pregnancy; interventions have resulted in an increase in the proportion of pregnant women reporting abstinence (odds ratio = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.43–3.56) (1). Previous national estimates have not characterized ASBI in populations of pregnant persons. Using 2017 and 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, CDC examined prevalence of ASBI and characteristics of pregnant persons and nonpregnant women aged 18–49 years (reproductive-aged women) residing in jurisdictions that participated in the BRFSS ASBI module. During their most recent health care visit within the past 2 years, approximately 80% of pregnant persons reported being asked about their alcohol use; however, only 16% of pregnant persons who self-reported current drinking at the time of the survey (at least one alcoholic beverage in the past 30 days) were advised by a health care provider to quit drinking or reduce their alcohol use. Further, the prevalence of screening among pregnant persons who did not graduate from high school was lower than that among those who did graduate from high school or had at least some college education. This gap between screening and brief intervention, along with disparities in screening based on educational level, indicate missed opportunities to reduce alcohol use during pregnancy. Strategies to enhance ASBI during pregnancy include integrating screenings into electronic health records, increasing reimbursement for ASBI services, developing additional tools, including electronic ASBI, that can be implemented in a variety of settings (2,3).
There is no known safe amount of alcohol, type of alcohol, or timing of alcohol use during pregnancy or while trying to become pregnant. Alcohol use among pregnant persons remains a public health concern. During 2015–2017, 11.5% of pregnant U.S. women aged 18–44 years reported current drinking (4), and during 2018–2020, 13.5% of pregnant adults aged 18–49 years reported current drinking (5). Brief intervention or behavioral counseling conducted in a primary care setting has been shown to increase the likelihood of abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy (1). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends implementing ASBI for all adults aged ≥18 years in primary health care settings, including those who are pregnant, to reduce excessive alcohol use, which includes any alcohol use while pregnant (6). Despite these recommendations for universal screening, some populations might not be screened as frequently as others (7).
BRFSS is a cross-sectional, random-digit–dialed, annual telephone survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults aged ≥18 years† that collects data on health-related behaviors. CDC analyzed data from 23 states and the District of Columbia§ that participated in an optional BRFSS ASBI module in 2017 and 2019¶ (unweighted sample size = 248,901; median response rate = 45.9% [2017] and 49.4% [2019]). For states that participated in the ASBI module both years (California, Kansas, and Nebraska), analytic weights were adjusted proportionally to their sample size for each year. Pregnant persons** and reproductive-aged women were compared by age, race and ethnicity,†† education level,§§ employment status,¶¶ disability status,*** HIV risk,††† experience of frequent mental distress,§§§ chronic conditions,¶¶¶ health insurance status,**** having a usual health care provider,†††† residence in a state with expanded Medicaid,§§§§ cigarette use,¶¶¶¶ any alcohol use,***** and binge drinking.††††† Analyses were conducted to estimate the prevalence of alcohol use and screening§§§§§ among pregnant persons and reproductive-aged women who visited a health care provider in the past 2 years. Prevalence of brief intervention¶¶¶¶¶ was calculated among pregnant persons.
Prevalence estimates and 95% CIs were standardized to the age distribution of persons who gave birth to a live singleton infant in 2017 using vital statistics data.****** Survey procedures with Taylor series variance and weights were used to account for the sample design and nonresponse. Wald chi-square tests were used to test for differences with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). BRFSS data are publicly available, and their use is not subject to human subjects review. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††††††
Among 950 pregnant persons in jurisdictions included in the 2017 and 2019 BRFSS ASBI module, 13.3% reported current drinking and 6.9% reported binge drinking (Table 1). Among reproductive-aged women, 56.4% reported current drinking and 20.2% reported binge drinking. Overall, 80.1% of pregnant persons and 86.0% of reproductive-aged women reported being screened for alcohol use at their last visit to a health care provider (Table 2). Pregnant persons who did not graduate from high school reported a lower prevalence of alcohol screening (53.5%) compared with those who graduated from high school (83.4%) and those with at least some college education (84.5%). A higher proportion of pregnant persons who reported behaviors that might increase the risk for HIV transmission were screened (95.8%) than were those without reported risk behaviors (78.6%). No significant differences in screening prevalence among pregnant persons were observed based on race and ethnicity, disability status, frequent mental distress, health insurance status, having a usual health care provider, or living in a Medicaid expansion state. However, among reproductive-aged women, screening prevalence was lower among those who were non-Hispanic and of another race or ethnicity (i.e., American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or multiracial) than among those who were Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic Black or African American, and non-Hispanic White. Screening prevalence was also lower among reproductive-aged women who did not have health insurance than among those with any health insurance. Among pregnant persons who reported current drinking at the time of the survey, 96.7% (95% CI = 93.4–100.0) reported having been screened at their most recent health care visit.
Approximately one quarter (25.3%; 95% CI = 19.6–31.0) of pregnant persons who received alcohol screening were offered advice from a health care provider about what level of drinking is harmful or risky to their health (including any amount of drinking during pregnancy), and 12.3% (95% CI = 7.6–17.0) were advised to reduce their intake or quit drinking (Figure). Among pregnant persons who reported being screened during their last health care visit and self-reported current drinking, 28.8% (95% CI = 12.2–45.4) were offered advice about what level of drinking is harmful or risky to health and 16.1% (95% CI = 6.9–25.3) were advised to reduce their alcohol intake or quit drinking.

Discussion
Despite recommendations for universal alcohol screening, approximately 20% of pregnant persons were not screened for alcohol use at their last visit to a primary health care provider, and among those with past 30-day alcohol use, only 16% who were screened were advised by a health care provider to quit drinking or reduce their alcohol use. Some groups of pregnant persons, such as those who did not graduate from high school and those who did not report behaviors that might increase the risk for HIV transmission, reported lower prevalences of screening compared with those who graduated from high school and those who reported behaviors that might increase HIV transmission risk. Screening prevalence was significantly lower among reproductive-aged women who did not have health insurance than among those with any health insurance, indicating that lack of health insurance might interfere with engaging in routine alcohol screening and subsequent interventions. In addition, racial and ethnic disparities in ASBI were observed among reproductive-aged women.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that health care providers conduct a brief intervention with all persons who are pregnant if they report any alcohol use (8). Approximately one third of pregnant persons who reported being screened during their most recent health care visit and self-reported current drinking received advice about what level of drinking is risky or harmful to health. This represents a missed opportunity for providers to discuss the potential adverse effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Brief interventions can vary in length, can be delivered in a wide variety of health care settings, and can be delivered either in person or electronically.§§§§§§
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, BRFSS relies on self-reported responses, which are subject to recall and social desirability biases. Second, not all pregnancies might be recognized at the time of health care visit or survey. Third, BRFSS does not ask for trimester of pregnancy, and although it is recognized that alcohol use varies across pregnancy (9), brief intervention is warranted irrespective of the timing of alcohol use during pregnancy. Fourth, because of the survey design, it could not be ascertained whether the health care provider screened for alcohol use and gave a brief intervention before or after the patient reported alcohol use, or if the patient was using alcohol at the time of the clinic visit. Fifth, specific sociodemographic subgroups of interest (e.g., veterans and sexual and gender minority groups) were not evaluated because of small sample sizes. Finally, because only jurisdictions that participated in the ASBI module were included, the findings in this report might not be generalizable to other jurisdictions.
Despite evidence that ASBI is effective in reducing alcohol use (1), this analysis indicates that ASBI is underutilized in certain populations of pregnant persons. Although alcohol screening among pregnant persons was high, one in five were not screened. Health care providers face multiple barriers in conducting ASBI (10); strategies to address these include integrating screenings into electronic health records, increasing reimbursement for ASBI services, implementing electronic ASBI (2), and developing training and tools for conducting ASBI in both traditional and nontraditional settings (3). Disparities in brief intervention highlight opportunities for expanding communication with patients who report alcohol consumption during pregnancy about associated risks to prevent and reduce adverse alcohol-associated pregnancy outcomes.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Substance use prevalence has increased among women with syphilis; however, its association with congenital syphilis is less clear.
What is added by this report?
During 2018–2021, the prevalence of substance use among persons with syphilis during pregnancy in Arizona and Georgia was nearly twice as high among those with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome (48.1%) as among those without this outcome (24.6%). Approximately one half of persons who used substances during pregnancy and had a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome had late or no prenatal care.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The need for syphilis screening and treatment should be addressed at every health care encounter during pregnancy, especially among persons using substances.

Despite universal prenatal syphilis screening recommendations and availability of effective antibiotic treatment, syphilis prevalence during pregnancy and the incidence of congenital syphilis have continued to increase in the United States (1,2). Concurrent increases in methamphetamine, injection drug, and heroin use have been described in women with syphilis (3). CDC used data on births that occurred during January 1, 2018–December 31, 2021, from two states (Arizona and Georgia) that participate in the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Pregnant People and Infants Network (SET-NET) to describe the prevalence of substance use among pregnant persons with syphilis by congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome (defined as delivery of a stillborn or live-born infant meeting the surveillance case definition for probable or confirmed congenital syphilis). The prevalence of substance use (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, illicit use of opioids, and other illicit, nonprescription substances) in persons with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome (48.1%) was nearly double that among those with a noncongenital syphilis pregnancy outcome (24.6%). Persons with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome were six times as likely to report illicit use of opioids and four times as likely to report using other illicit, nonprescription substances during pregnancy than were persons with a noncongenital syphilis pregnancy outcome. Approximately one half of persons who used substances during pregnancy and had a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome had late or no prenatal care. Tailored interventions should address barriers and facilitators to accessing screening and treatment for syphilis among persons who use substances. The need for syphilis screening and treatment should be addressed at any health care encounter during pregnancy, especially among persons who use substances.
SET-NET is a longitudinal surveillance approach established to identify infectious exposures, including syphilis, during pregnancy and monitor health outcomes in pregnant persons and their infants (4). In collaboration with CDC, Arizona and Georgia conducted enhanced surveillance for both syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis based on case investigations, medical records, and linkage of laboratory results with vital records. Arizona focused surveillance efforts on Maricopa, Pima, and Yuma counties (approximately 80% of the state’s births); Georgia’s surveillance was statewide. Pregnancies were included if 1) the person met the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition* for syphilis (all stages) at any point during pregnancy or 2) the person had a syphilitic stillborn or live-born infant or child who met the CSTE case definition for probable or confirmed congenital syphilis. Substance use during pregnancy, obtained from case investigation interviews or from medical records, included use of tobacco (e.g., cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, or e-cigarettes), alcohol, cannabis, illicit use of opioids (e.g., prescription opioids not taken as prescribed, fentanyl, or heroin), and other illicit, nonprescription substances (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamines, inhalants, or hallucinogens such as LSD or PCP).
Births that occurred during January 1, 2018–December 31, 2021,† and were reported to CDC as of September 9, 2022, were analyzed to compare the prevalence of any substance use among pregnant persons with syphilis by whether their pregnancy outcome met the surveillance case definition for probable or confirmed congenital syphilis§ (congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome) or did not (noncongenital syphilis pregnancy outcome) and to describe selected demographic, prenatal care, clinical and treatment information, and history of incarceration and homelessness in the 12 months preceding case report or positive test results or during pregnancy. All analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 4.1.2; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶
Among 770 pregnant persons who met inclusion criteria (17 with multiple gestations), 360 (46.8%) had a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome (Table 1). Among 309 persons with a noncongenital syphilis pregnancy outcome and who did not use substances, 47.2% were aged <25 years, compared with 31.8% of those with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome who used substances. The prevalence of other age groups was distributed similarly across congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome and substance use status.
Among persons with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome, 53.2% of those who used substances and 32.1% of those who did not use substances received late (third trimester) or no prenatal care. Among persons with a noncongenital syphilis pregnancy outcome, 16.8% of those who used a substance and 6.1% of those who did not use a substance received late or no prenatal care. Irrespective of congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome, 39.8% of persons who used substances during pregnancy (274) either did not receive prenatal care or received it in the third trimester compared with 15.9% for those without substance use during pregnancy (496). Persons who used substances had, on average, six prenatal care visits, and those without substance use had nine. Among persons who used substances during pregnancy, 38.2% of those with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome received no prenatal care, compared with 4.0% of those with a noncongenital syphilis pregnancy outcome.
Among persons with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome, adequate treatment was received by 15.0% of those who did use any substances during pregnancy and 24.6% who did not. More than one half (53.2%) of 173 persons with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome and who used substances received no treatment for syphilis during pregnancy, compared with 42.2% of 187 persons who did not use substances.
Among persons who used substances during pregnancy, 16.2% of persons with a congenital syphilis outcome and 10.9% of persons with a noncongenital syphilis outcome had a history of incarceration; for history of homelessness in these groups the frequency was 26.6% and 8.9%. Data on incarceration were missing or not reported for 39% of all persons included in this analysis. Data on homelessness were missing or not reported for 35% of all persons included in this analysis.
Persons with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome were almost twice as likely to have used any substance during pregnancy as were those without this outcome (48.1% versus 24.6%; prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.95) (Table 2). Illicit use of opioids and illicit, nonprescription substances were the substance uses most frequently associated with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome. Illicit use of opioids during pregnancy was six times higher (PR = 6.09) and use of other illicit, nonprescription substances was more than four times higher (PR = 4.41) among persons with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome compared with those with a noncongenital syphilis outcome.

Discussion
Among pregnant persons in Arizona and Georgia, substance use prevalence was higher among those with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome than among those with a noncongenital syphilis outcome; the largest difference was observed in persons who used opioids illicitly or used other illicit, nonprescription substances. Consistent with previous research (5); the prevalence of late or no prenatal care was high among persons who used any substance during pregnancy, and those who did receive care had fewer prenatal visits. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of syphilis are critical to reducing adverse syphilis-related outcomes for persons who are pregnant, congenital syphilis, and overall syphilis transmission. The need for syphilis screening and treatment should be addressed at any health care encounter during pregnancy, especially among persons who use substances, and in all health care encounters with persons of childbearing age who have a high risk for syphilitic infection (6). Although syphilis is highly treatable with penicillin G (5,7), one third of persons in this analysis who used any substances remained untreated.
Previous studies suggest that social determinants of health, including incarceration and homelessness, might be associated with substance use and contribute to deficiencies in care and syphilis treatment (5,8). Although this study included small numbers and had high levels of missingness for history of incarceration and homelessness, up to one quarter of those who used substances and had a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome had a history of incarceration or homelessness. Prioritizing persons with these lived experiences for screening and treatment of syphilis at every health care encounter is critical, and innovative strategies need to be developed to reach these populations.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, data collection is ongoing and is from only two states. Data from one of these states are restricted to only three counties; however, these counties represent approximately 80% of births in the state. Prevalence of substance use and other risk factors for congenital syphilis likely vary by jurisdiction, thereby limiting the generalizability of these results. Second, stigma and social desirability bias might have resulted in underreporting of substance use and contributed to the high missingness identified for history of incarceration and homelessness (9). Further, self-reported substance use creates the potential for recall bias by congenital syphilis status if captured retrospectively (after the birth) among those with a congenital syphilis pregnancy outcome. Fourth, because treatment is highly effective, the finding of 20% of persons with adequate treatment among those with congenital syphilis outcome could be an artifact of the CSTE case definition, which includes nonspecific clinical findings for probable cases or could be related to occult or undiagnosed reinfection that could not be assessed. Finally, there is no age limit for diagnosing congenital syphilis, which might create some misclassification in these data; however, almost all congenital syphilis cases are diagnosed during the neonatal period (10).
This report highlights the value of the SET-NET surveillance approach of linking data on pregnant persons to data on infants to understand factors related to congenital syphilis. The increasing numbers of congenital syphilis cases across the United States demand further exploration of factors that contribute to this trend and development of strategies to address missed opportunities for diagnosis and treatment before, during, and after pregnancy (1,2). Although screening and treatment can prevent most cases of congenital syphilis, numerous barriers to implementing these prevention strategies exist, some of which might be amplified among persons who use substances. Tailored interventions need to address barriers and facilitators for accessing screening and treatment for syphilis for persons with current or previous substance use, including those with a history of incarceration and homelessness.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The number of mpox cases reported from rural areas in West and Central Africa had been increasing before 2018.
What is added by this report?
During 2018–2021, mpox cases were confirmed in six African countries. Eight primary and three secondary cases associated with travel to Nigeria were identified in four non-African countries. Online training courses on mpox prevention and control have been available since 2018.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Mpox continues to present challenges to public health and health care personnel in endemic areas. Improvements in surveillance and community engagement will be critical to detection and containment of the virus. Vaccines and treatments might reduce morbidity and mortality in areas with endemic disease.

Table 2
Monkeypox (mpox) is a zoonotic disease caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), an Orthopoxvirus; the wild mammalian reservoir species is not known. There are two genetic clades of MPXV: clade I and clade II (historically found in central and west Africa, respectively), with only Cameroon reporting both clades (1). Human cases have historically been reported from 1) mostly rural, forested areas in some central and west African countries; 2) countries reporting cases related to population migration or travel of infected persons; and 3) exposure to imported infected mammals (2). The annual number of cases in Africa has risen since 2014 and cumulatively surpassed reports from the previous 40 years for most countries. This reemergence of mpox might be due to a combination of environmental and ecological changes, animal or human movement, the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination since its eradication in 1980, improvements in disease detection and diagnosis, and genetic changes in the virus (2). This report describes the epidemiology of mpox since 1970 and during 2018–2021, using data from national surveillance programs, World Health Organization (WHO) bulletins, and case reports, and addresses current diagnostic and treatment challenges in countries with endemic disease. During 2018–2021, human cases were recognized and confirmed in six African countries, with most detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Nigeria. The reemergence and increase in cases resulted in its being listed in 2019 as a priority disease for immediate and routine reporting through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response strategy in the WHO African region.* In eight instances, patients with mpox were identified in four countries outside of Africa after travel from Nigeria. Since 2018, introductory and intermediate training courses on prevention and control of mpox for public health and health care providers have been available online at OpenWHO.†,§ The global outbreak that began in May 2022¶ has further highlighted the need for improvements in laboratory-based surveillance and access to treatments and vaccines to prevent and contain the infection, including in areas of Africa with endemic mpox.
Annual mpox case and death counts during 2018–2021 were compiled from national surveillance data, WHO bulletins, and published case reports or outbreak investigations, and were verified with country surveillance teams; these data are presented with human mpox case report data since 1970. Since 2018, cases occurred in six African countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), DRC, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo (ROC), and Sierra Leone (Table 1) (Figure). DRC reported >3,000 suspected cases per year, with a peak of 6,216 cases and 222 deaths in 2020. During 2018–2021, the number of confirmed mpox cases in CAR (79) from seven localities represented a notable increase compared with previous years, and an average of nine annual mpox outbreaks have occurred in CAR since 2018. In addition, nine cases were confirmed in Cameroon, where no human case of mpox had been documented since 1989; in a 2018 case, the virus shared genetic similarity with a clade II strain previously isolated from Nigeria (1), and additional cases were reported in different regions of the country in 2020 and 2021. Two cases each in ROC and Sierra Leone were reported during 2018–2021.
After 39 years without reports, Nigeria experienced a reemergence of cases caused by Clade II beginning in August 2017; this outbreak culminated in May 2018 with 122 confirmed or probable cases among 17 states and included seven deaths (3). The country has continued to report mpox cases, with most concentrated in the southernmost states, including in urban settings since the outbreak period. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases reported in Nigeria declined sharply (eight cases reported); however, case reports rose again in 2021. Nigeria has had a number of patients with MPXV and HIV coinfections, including four of the seven fatal cases in 2018. In addition, clinicians noticed atypical presentation that included lesions first appearing on the genitals and the absence of a febrile prodrome (3,4). Five cases were reported in a prison in 2017, highlighting the need for infection prevention and control in high-density settings, such as correctional facilities and shelters, to prevent person-to-person transmission (3).
During 2018–2021, eight independent travel-associated cases of mpox occurred outside Africa in persons traveling from Nigeria (Table 2). The patients were all men aged 30–50 years, and three reported that the rash first appeared in the groin area (5–7). In one instance, secondary transmission resulted in an infection in a health care provider, and in another instance, in two family members. Each travel-associated case required public health resources to identify community contacts (including airline passengers in some cases) and health care contacts, and to establish care and treatment under strict infection prevention and control measures in health care and some residential environments (6).
In 2021, WHO conducted a survey of orthopoxvirus testing capacity in 127 global laboratories. Among these, 78 (61%) reported working with orthopoxviruses for diagnostic (50), research (52), vaccine development (15), or manufacturing (four) purposes; and 38 (30%) worked with MPXV. Laboratories working with orthopoxviruses were present in the European (30 laboratories), Americas (21), African (11), Eastern Mediterranean (two), Southeast Asian (three), and Western Pacific (11) regions.

Discussion
MPXV was first identified in 1970 in DRC during the global effort to eradicate smallpox, a disease caused by another Orthopoxvirus (Variola virus). It was during the period of intensified surveillance for smallpox-like disease in the early 1980s that the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and transmission of mpox were largely defined. It was also during this time that investigations to identify mammalian reservoir species in the regions of Africa with endemic disease (largely in DRC with clade I) occurred. Additional assessments of human disease, including refinements of the different clinical spectrum of illness and epidemiology associated with clade II, occurred during a multistate U.S. outbreak in 2003 associated with the exotic pet trade (8). The impact of the route of exposure on disease severity and presentation has been well documented (8); however, it was not until the 2017 outbreak in Nigeria when the propensity of clade II MPXV for human-to-human transmission and clinical severity, including death, were recognized (3).
Mpox continues to present challenges to public health and health care providers in areas with endemic disease owing to inadequate capacity to diagnose and clinically manage patients and accurately identify exposures. WHO launched an introductory mpox course in 2018 and an intermediate course in December 2021 with content tailored to clinicians and public health providers. The intermediate course offers in-depth information on the epidemiology, presentation, diagnostics, and treatment of mpox and strategies needed for effective prevention and outbreak response, based on information available by late 2021. As of December 14, 2022, 62,196 persons had enrolled in the introductory course and 41,578 had enrolled in the intermediate course.
Until 2017, cases almost exclusively occurred in forested, rural areas where populations might be dependent on wild animal meat for protein. Case-control studies focused on identifying hunting activities that might lead to exposure have not been able to identify a presumptive animal reservoir species. Additional investigations are warranted to examine human interactions with live and dead wild animals, animal meat, and animal products used for cultural, religious, or medicinal purposes. A holistic investigative approach conducted by trained interviewers to identify any risk linked to the diversity of human activities associated with wild animals could be beneficial.
Patients might have difficulty reporting exposures to animals infected with MPXV or to other persons with mpox if exposures are unrecognized. In addition, patients might not provide information regarding possible exposures from sexual interactions if the interactions are associated with stigma or even criminalization. The 2017 outbreak data from Nigeria yielded hypotheses about the role of sexual contact for many of the cases, but investigators were unable to pinpoint this as a significant route of transmission (3,4). Training of case investigators in stigma-free interview skills and compassionate care might help to better understand mpox transmission, including in historically long-affected areas.
Continued advancements in laboratory diagnostic assays and validation of additional specimen types during the course of infection will aid the ability to detect MPXV, and use of these assays in areas with endemic disease will be necessary to improve surveillance capacity. Laboratory capacity for Orthopoxvirus detection has been limited in Africa, hindering the confirmatory diagnosis of suspected mpox disease. Molecular testing (via polymerase chain reaction testing) of lesion specimens has been a standard and effective method of diagnosis of cases in persons with active rash illness. The lack of MPXV-specific serology and existence of cross-reactivity with other orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia virus, hampers the use of serology as a confirmatory test for diagnosis of an infection. This poses challenges for ecologic investigations, where wild mammals must be sampled during an active infection or soon thereafter, as detectable virus and viral DNA appear to be quickly cleared from mucosal surfaces and major organ systems in putative reservoir species (9). Further work is needed to better understand the dynamics of disease, including viral dissemination and shedding, in small mammals to guide investigations of animal reservoirs.
Treatment of MPXV infection in patients with immunosuppression due to health conditions is challenging (4,10). Notwithstanding very limited compassionate use of therapeutics and the launch of some clinical trials and expanded access protocols during the 2022 global outbreak, patient treatment is still dependent on supportive care in both rural and urban areas in many countries (10). Research on safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics against orthopoxviruses has been sustained under the smallpox preparedness research agenda mandated and overseen by WHO.** Additional data are needed to assess the efficacy of vaccines and treatments for mpox to develop recommendations and guidance for their use. Such research should be considered in affected countries in partnership with local scientific, and public health authorities. The findings in this report are limited to reporting of cases, which might be incomplete.
Countries with enzootic mpox face an increasingly complex epidemiologic situation, which might include extensive human-to-human transmission, in addition to zoonotic transmission. The use of nonstigmatizing methods for community engagement in populations at risk will be critical to detection and containment. Advances in diagnostics, treatments, and safer vaccines identified through basic and clinical research including during the current outbreak response might be used to improve surveillance, treatment, and prevention of disease in areas where mpox is endemic.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines increase protection against infection and severe disease. However, few eligible U.S. residents have received a bivalent booster dose, and factors underlying low coverage are unclear.
What is added by this report?
An online opt-in survey of 1,200 previously vaccinated U.S. residents found that the most common reasons for not getting a bivalent booster dose were lack of awareness about eligibility or availability and overconfidence in immunity; reasons varied by age group.
What are the implications for public health practice?
All eligible adults should receive a bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine. To help increase bivalent booster dose coverage, health care and public health professionals should use evidence-based strategies to inform persons about booster vaccine recommendations and waning immunity.

Bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines, developed to protect against both ancestral and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variants, are recommended to increase protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease* (1,2). However, relatively few eligible U.S. adults have received a bivalent booster dose (3), and reasons for low coverage are unclear. An opt-in Internet survey of 1,200 COVID-19–vaccinated U.S. adults was conducted to assess reasons for receiving or not receiving a bivalent booster dose. Participants could select multiple reasons from a list of suggested reasons to report why they had or had not received a bivalent booster dose. The most common reasons cited for not receiving the bivalent booster dose were lack of awareness of eligibility for vaccination (23.2%) or of vaccine availability (19.3%), and perceived immunity against infection (18.9%). After viewing information about eligibility and availability, 67.8% of participants who had not received the bivalent booster dose indicated that they planned to do so; in a follow-up survey 1 month later, 28.6% of these participants reported having received the dose. Among those who had planned to receive the booster dose but had not yet done so, 82.6% still intended to do so. Participants who had still not received the booster dose most commonly reported being too busy to get vaccinated (35.6%). To help increase bivalent booster dose coverage, health care and public health professionals should use evidence-based strategies to convey information about booster vaccination recommendations and waning immunity (4), while also working to increase convenient access.
Participants were recruited via Prolific, an online survey platform.† Eligible participants included persons who were aged ≥18 years, fluent in English, U.S. residents, and had received ≥1 previous COVID-19 vaccine dose. Quota-sampling was used to recruit approximately equal numbers of adults aged 18–39, 40–59, and ≥60 years. Because of low racial and ethnic diversity among persons in the Prolific participant pool (most identified as non-Hispanic White [White]), particularly among adults aged ≥60 years and those who had previously received a COVID-19 vaccine, the sample was not weighted by race or ethnicity. Data collection occurred during November 1–5, 2022 (initial survey), and December 6–10 (follow-up survey). CDC first recommended a bivalent booster dose for persons aged ≥12 years on September 1, 2022. Participants were not informed during the initial survey that they would later be recontacted for a follow-up survey. This study was reviewed and approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board.§
Participants reported dates of all previous COVID-19 infections (as determined by positive rapid test results or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results) and COVID-19 vaccine doses. Participants who reported receiving a bivalent booster dose viewed a randomly ordered set of 10 suggested reasons for getting the booster dose,¶ and could select multiple reasons that contributed to their decision, as well as optionally input other reasons.** Similarly, participants who had not received a bivalent booster dose could select from a different randomly ordered set of 10 reasons for not getting the booster dose,†† and optionally input other reasons; they then viewed information about bivalent booster vaccine eligibility and availability.§§ After viewing this information, participants who had not received a bivalent booster dose reported whether they planned to receive it and were recontacted via Prolific after 1 month to complete a follow-up survey. Descriptive statistics were calculated using R (version 4.1.1; R Foundation). Survey materials, data, and code used for data preprocessing and analysis are available online.¶¶
The initial survey included 1,200 participants, with approximately one third in each age group (Table 1). Nearly two thirds (65.4%) of participants were White, and approximately one half (51.9%) were women. Most participants (95.8%) had received ≥2 COVID-19 vaccine doses; among these participants, 396 (34.4%) had received the bivalent booster dose, and 714 (62.1%) had not. Participants who had received only 1 vaccine dose (50) or were unsure if they had received a bivalent booster dose (41) were excluded from further analyses.
The 396 participants who had received the bivalent booster dose selected a median of five reasons for getting it.*** The most common reasons were to protect oneself (90.7%), prevent severe disease (80.6%), and protect others (75.0%) (Figure); these top reasons were consistent among age groups.
The 714 participants who had not received the bivalent booster dose selected a median of one reason for not receiving it (Figure).††† Reasons for not receiving the bivalent booster dose differed among age groups (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/123508). Among adults aged 18–39 years, the most commonly reported reasons for not receiving the bivalent booster dose were being unaware that they were eligible (29.8%), being unaware that updated booster doses were available (23.5%), or believing they still had strong protection against infection (18.4%). The most commonly reported reasons among adults aged 40–59 years were being unaware that they were eligible (22.1%) or believing they still had strong protection against severe disease (21.3%) or infection (18.5%). Among adults aged ≥60 years, the most commonly reported reasons were believing they still had strong protection against infection (20.2%), concern about side effects (17.5%), or being unsure whether the bivalent booster dose was effective (16.1%).
Adults aged 40–59 and ≥60 years commonly reported not receiving a booster dose because they believed they were already sufficiently protected against infection or severe disease. However, among 223 participants who cited one or both of these reasons, 160 (71.7%) had not experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection or received a COVID-19 vaccine dose within the preceding 6 months, and 114 (51.1%) had never been infected.
Reasons for nonvaccination were descriptively grouped into the following three categories: 1) lack of awareness (related to eligibility and availability), 2) perceived immunity (i.e., self-perceived strong protection against infection or severe disease), and 3) concern and uncertainty (related to vaccine effectiveness, safety, and side effects). Reasons within each descriptive category were more often reported together (co-occurrence frequency >15%)§§§ (Table 2).
After participants who had not received the booster dose (714) selected their reasons, they read a message about vaccine eligibility and availability and then reported their intention to get the booster dose. Overall, more than two thirds (67.8% [484 of 714]) indicated that they planned to get the booster dose (similar across age groups). Among those who had reported being unaware about eligibility or availability, 88.0% (227 of 258) indicated that they planned to get the booster dose.
After 1 month, the 714 participants who had not received the booster dose at the initial evaluation were recontacted; 624 (87.4%) completed the follow-up survey (Table 1). Among 427 (68.4%) participants who planned to receive the booster dose, 122 (28.6%) had done so. In contrast, among 197 participants who did not plan to receive the booster dose, nine (4.6%) had received it. Among the 305 participants who planned to get the booster dose but had not yet done so, 252 (82.6%) still intended to get it, three (1.0%) no longer planned to get it, and 50 (16.4%) were unsure. Recontacted participants who still had not received the booster dose selected reasons again¶¶¶; the most common reasons were being too busy (35.6%), forgetting (22.7%), and worrying about side effects (22.7%).****

Discussion
In this online survey aimed at understanding reasons for low bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccination coverage, the most common reasons for not receiving a bivalent booster dose were lack of awareness of eligibility (23.2%) or availability (19.3%) and perceived existing protection against infection (18.9%), although top reasons differed across age groups. Bivalent booster dose coverage in the U.S. was low when the survey was conducted (12.1% of adults), and currently remains low (18.2% of adults) (3). Increasing bivalent booster vaccination coverage will require a multifaceted approach (4) to address reasons for nonvaccination.
Lack of awareness about eligibility to receive a booster dose and vaccine availability were among the three most common reasons for not receiving the booster dose among adults aged 18–39 and 40–59 years. After viewing information about current booster vaccination guidelines, most participants who had been unaware of their eligibility or about availability reported planning to get the booster dose. Increased outreach, such as through provider recommendations and trusted messengers (4,5), is necessary to increase awareness of eligibility criteria and vaccine availability. Increasing awareness is a crucial first step toward increasing coverage; promotion of tools that provide vaccination guidance (such as CDC’s COVID-19 booster tool)†††† by public health authorities and trusted messengers might help encourage persons who are unsure about bivalent booster dose recommendations to receive the booster dose.
Other respondents did not receive a booster dose because they believed they were protected against infection or severe disease because of previous vaccination or infection. These reasons were among those most frequently cited by adults aged 40–59 and ≥60 years. Among participants who cited these reasons, nearly three quarters had not experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection or received a COVID-19 vaccine dose within the preceding 6 months, and more than one half had never been infected. Because of waning of vaccine- and infection-conferred immunity and evolving viral variants (6,7), these participants likely overestimated their protection. An online intervention has been shown to correct inaccurate estimation of COVID-19 exposure risk (8); similar strategies could correct misconceptions about the need for COVID-19 bivalent booster vaccination, such as interactive online tools that provide personalized immunity estimates.
Some participants expressed concern about bivalent booster dose side effects, safety, and effectiveness. These concerns were among the most frequent reasons for not receiving the booster dose among adults aged ≥60 years. Increasing awareness of emerging safety and effectiveness data related to bivalent booster vaccination among providers and public health messengers could help address these concerns (1,2,5).
After 1 month, 29% of participants who had planned to get the bivalent booster dose had received it; 83% of those who had not yet received a booster dose still planned to receive it. Recontacted participants who had not received the booster dose most commonly reported being too busy, forgetting, or worrying about side effects. Reminders from providers and trusted messengers, accommodations (e.g., time off work to recover), and convenient access (e.g., at workplaces, schools, or shopping centers) might motivate persons to act on their intentions (4,5). Increased awareness of safety data could also address concerns about side effects.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, most users in the Prolific participant pool identified as White (particularly among adults aged ≥60 years and previously COVID-19–vaccinated adults), making it impossible to weight the sample by race or ethnicity to represent the general U.S. population. Second, the survey used a nonprobability sample, and the cumulative response rate cannot be reported because Prolific does not report the number of users who viewed a survey but did not opt-in. Third, inferences are limited to persons who received ≥2 previous COVID-19 vaccine doses. These three limitations constrain the generalizability of the findings as well as inferences about demographic or geographic differences. Previous studies have demonstrated racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 booster vaccination (9); reasons for nonvaccination might differ among communities because of work, transportation, or language barriers. Fourth, self-reported information is subject to social desirability and recall biases (10); participants might have felt pressured to provide socially desirable answers or inaccurately recalled past experiences, which limits the interpretability of the survey responses. Fifth, the survey only assessed booster vaccination intentions at the end of the survey, making it difficult to determine whether providing information about vaccination eligibility or vaccine availability influenced intentions. Finally, because of selection bias, those who had strong opinions about COVID-19 vaccination might have been more likely to participate.
This study identified lack of awareness, perceived immunity, and concern and uncertainty as important reasons underlying low adult bivalent booster vaccination coverage. All eligible adults should receive a bivalent booster dose to protect themselves against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease. To help increase bivalent booster coverage, health care professionals and public health practitioners should use evidence-based strategies to convey information about booster vaccination recommendations and waning immunity, in addition to increasing convenient access to vaccination.

† Prolific is an online survey platform (www.prolific.co/). Participants were paid $1 for a survey that took 3–5 minutes to complete. After 1 month, participants were recontacted for a 1.5-minute follow-up survey that paid $1. Survey creators recruit participants on the basis of previous responses to a demographic survey administered by Prolific; only participants who met the eligibility criteria were able to view the study and opt in.
§ 45 C.F.R. part 46; 21 C.F.R. part 56.
¶ Suggested reasons for receiving the booster dose are as follows: 1) I wanted to protect myself; 2) I wanted to protect others; 3) I wanted to prevent my own severe illness due to COVID-19; 4) I wanted to prevent my own long-term symptoms due to COVID-19 (long COVID); 5) My doctor (or other health care provider) recommended getting the booster dose; 6) I wanted to prevent life disruption due to COVID-19 (e.g., missing work or vacations); 7) CDC recommended getting the booster dose; 8) My friend or family members got the booster dose; 9) I read content in the news or on social media about the booster dose; and 10) My employer or school required it.
** Participants optionally input other text to describe additional reasons (31.6% among those who had already received the bivalent booster dose, and 53.9% among those who had not). However, because many of these responses were not informative (e.g., writing “nothing to add” or providing a reason that was redundant with a reason already selected from the list), these text-entry responses were excluded from analyses.
†† Suggested reasons for not receiving the booster dose are as follows: 1) I believe I still have strong protection against COVID-19 infection; 2) I believe I still have strong protection against severe illness due to COVID-19; 3) I didn’t want to experience vaccine side effects; 4) I couldn’t take time off work to get the vaccine or recover afterwards; 5) I believe the vaccines are not effective anymore; 6) I didn’t know the new booster was available; 7) I didn’t know if I was eligible for the new booster; 8) It’s too much effort to get the booster shot; 9) I don’t know if the new formula is effective; and 10) I don’t know if the new formula is safe.
§§ Participants read a message describing CDC recommendations and eligibility criteria for bivalent booster doses along with a link to an appointment-finding tool (https://www.vaccines.gov/search/). Click-tracking indicated that 5.7% of participants clicked on the link, although this measure might fail to count some clicks (e.g., if a participant copied and pasted the link or used a keyboard shortcut to open it in a new tab or window). Participants might have been unlikely to click the link because of concerns about losing their place in the survey.
¶¶ https://osf.io/t3szm/
*** 6.6% of participants cited one reason, 5.3% cited two reasons, 9.6% cited three reasons, 14.6% cited four reasons, and 63.9% cited five or more reasons.
††† 7.0% did not cite any of the suggested reasons, 61.3% cited one reason, 22.7% cited two reasons, and 15.3% cited three or more reasons.
§§§ Although only one third of participants cited more than one reason, recommendations based on the descriptive categories (lack of awareness, perceived immunity, and concern and uncertainty) apply to all participants who chose one or more of the reasons associated with each category.
¶¶¶ Suggested reasons for not receiving the booster dose in the follow-up study are as follows (listed in order of prevalence): 1) I’ve been too busy to get the booster dose; 2) I didn’t want to experience vaccine side effects; 3) I intended to get the booster dose, but I forgot to make an appointment; 4) I believe I still have strong protection against COVID-19 infection; 5) I believe I still have strong protection against severe illness due to COVID-19; 6) I don’t know if the new formula is effective; 7) I don’t know if the new formula is safe; 8) I had COVID-19 recently, so I think I should wait before getting a booster dose; 9) I believe the vaccines are not effective anymore; 10) I couldn’t take time off work to get the vaccine or recover afterwards; 11) I am still not sure if I am eligible to receive a booster dose; and 12) I am not sure if vaccine doses (or the specific brand I prefer) are available near me.
**** In the follow-up survey, among the subset of participants (305) who were unsure or no longer planned to get the booster dose, the top reasons for not getting it were being too busy (37.7%), concern about side effects (34.0%), and strong perceived protection against infection (24.5%) and severe disease (24.5%).

* The initial sample consisted of 1,200 previously COVID-19–vaccinated U.S. residents.
† The follow-up survey consisted of 624 participants from the initial survey, recontacted after 1 month. Only participants who had reported not yet receiving the bivalent booster dose during the initial survey were recontacted.
§ Persons of Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) origin might be of any race but are categorized as Hispanic; all racial groups are non-Hispanic. Persons identified as being of multiple races had more than one race category selected. Persons identified as “other” race selected the “other” option or identified as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.
¶ Participants who were unsure whether they had received a bivalent booster dose were excluded from analyses (41). In addition, participants who had received only 1 previous COVID-19 vaccine dose were excluded from analyses (50), because those who did not complete a primary series (or received a 1-dose primary vaccine) might not be eligible to receive a bivalent booster dose or might have different reasons for receiving booster doses. One participant reported both having received 1 dose and also being unsure about their bivalent booster vaccination status; thus, a total of 90 participants were excluded.
** Participants reported all previous SARS-CoV-2 infections for which they had received a positive test result (rapid test or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test).

On June 14, 2021, an industrial manufacturing facility in Winnebago County, Illinois caught fire and released smoke, dust, and debris, requiring evacuation of the area in the vicinity of the facility for 4 days. Following the emergency response, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and Winnebago County Health Department (WCHD) requested assistance from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to conduct a community Assessment of Chemical Exposure (ACE). That assessment found that almost one half of respondents reported symptoms during the 2 weeks after the fire (1).
One year after the fire, IDPH and WCHD invited ATSDR to conduct a follow-up ACE investigation to assess ongoing health impacts. WCHD and ATSDR emailed a modified survey to all 2,030 previous 2021 survey respondents, through the existing electronic system, to collect information related to ongoing exposure and mental and physical health symptoms. This investigation team also conducted a total of 22 semistructured interviews to collect open-ended responses to questions regarding mental health symptoms and community needs. Nine residents of a neighborhood adjacent to the fire site were interviewed in-person and 13 survey respondents who expressed interest in participating were interviewed by phone.
Among the 2,030 previous survey respondents, 33% (676) completed the follow-up survey. In the follow-up survey, 39% (265) of respondents reported new or worsening mental health symptoms since the fire, among whom 98% were still experiencing these symptoms 1 year after the fire; 59% (400) reported new or worsening physical health symptoms, among whom 90% were still experiencing these symptoms 1 year after the fire.
Semistructured interviews enriched the quantitative information from the electronic survey and revealed themes related to anxiety, disappointment in communication, and overall poor mental health. More formal qualitative analysis is underway; however, preliminary findings suggest that residents were unable to easily access information related to environmental exposures or fire-site cleanup efforts. In addition, when information was available, respondents found it to be overly technical and difficult to interpret.
The semistructured interviews also provided an opportunity for residents to offer unprompted remarks. Residents reported avoidance of previous activities, such as gardening, because of concerns about fire-related contaminants. This information provides local authorities with specific actions such as targeted community environmental risk education.
This follow-up ACE investigation provided informative and immediately actionable data. Communities that have experienced a similar type of fire or environmental disaster would benefit from a consolidated source of information, summarized in easily understandable, plain language. The CDC Clear Communication Index is a set of research-based criteria that can be used to craft messages in an effective, interpretable way, especially for complex scientific information related to toxic substances (2). One limitation of this analysis is that data collected following disasters might be biased toward more reported adverse outcomes than those representative of the overall community (3).
Lessons learned from the follow-up survey are being applied to both the chemical fire and other environmental exposures such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in water systems in Winnebago County. WCHD is working with IDPH and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency on communications about chemical exposures that incorporate the concepts highlighted by this qualitative study including transparency about what is unknown and simple communications based on the CDC Clear Communication Index.
This investigation documented persistent mental and physical health symptoms reported among residents 1 year after a chemical fire, highlighted the importance of clear and accessible public health communications (4), and informed local authorities about previously unrecognized concerns. A follow-up ACE investigation for environmental disaster events by public health authorities can help gauge long-term health concerns and demonstrate ongoing investment in the wellbeing of affected communities.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The first cholera outbreak in Haiti was reported in October 2010. Haiti was declared cholera-free in February 2022, after 3 years with no confirmed cases.
What is added by this report?
On October 2, 2022, two cases of Vibrio cholerae O1 infection were confirmed in the greater Port-au-Prince area. As of January 3, 2023, >20,000 suspected cholera cases had been reported throughout the country.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Multiple factors, including social unrest, have affected public health infrastructure and facilitated cholera resurgence. Although cases have declined, a multipronged approach, including sufficient and timely case management, strengthened surveillance, emergency water treatment, and targeted oral cholera vaccination campaigns are urgently needed.

On September 30, 2022, after >3 years with no confirmed cholera cases (1), the Directorate of Epidemiology, Laboratories and Research (DELR) of the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population [MSPP]) was notified of two patients with acute, watery diarrhea in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince. Within 2 days, Haiti’s National Public Health Laboratory confirmed the bacterium Vibrio cholerae O1 in specimens from the two patients with suspected cholera infection, and an outbreak investigation began immediately. As of January 3, 2023, >20,000 suspected cholera cases had been reported throughout the country, and 79% of patients have been hospitalized. The moving 14-day case fatality ratio (CFR) was 3.0%. Cholera, which is transmitted through ingestion of water or food contaminated with fecal matter, can cause acute, severe, watery diarrhea that can rapidly lead to dehydration, shock, and death if not treated promptly (2). Haiti is currently facing ongoing worsening of gang violence, population displacement, social unrest, and insecurity, particularly in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, including Belair, Bas-Delmas, Centre-Ville, Martissant, Cité Soleil, Croix-des Bouquets, and Tabarre, creating an environment that has facilitated the current resurgence of cholera (3). This report describes the initial investigation, ongoing outbreak, and public health response to cholera in Haiti. Cholera outbreak responses require a multipronged, multisectoral approach including surveillance; case management; access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services; targeted oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaigns; risk communication; and community engagement. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*

Epidemiologic Investigation
On September 30, 2022, DELR was alerted about a pediatric patient with acute watery diarrhea in Haiti’s Ouest Department,† who was treated at a health center operated by Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières [MSF]). The patient was from the Carrefour Feuille area in Port-au-Prince, had been seen at an MSF health clinic on September 29, 2022, and died shortly after arrival. Also, on September 29, MSF reported a fatal case of acute, watery diarrhea from Cité Soleil, a densely populated commune of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince. On October 2, Haiti’s National Public Health Laboratory confirmed these two suspected cholera cases, both in the greater Port-au-Prince area, to be V. cholerae O1 (El Tor biotype) of the Ogawa serotype by culture and seroagglutination. Subsequent sequencing of one of these patients’ stool samples revealed the strains to be very similar to the strain that caused the cholera epidemic in Haiti in 2010, suggesting the resurgence of cholera in Haiti (4).
MSPP defined a suspected case of cholera as the occurrence of acute, watery diarrhea, with or without vomiting or dehydration, in a person of any age. Confirmed cases were defined as any suspected case with a positive culture for V. cholerae or with an epidemiologic link with a confirmed case. Not all suspected cases undergo confirmatory testing. As of January 3, 2023, MSPP had reported 280 institutional (health care facility) deaths and 177 community deaths through the daily alert-based reporting system§ (a system through which surveillance officers obtain daily counts of cases and deaths from the reporting facilities); the moving 14-day CFR was 3.0% (Figure 1). As of January 3, Haiti’s case-based surveillance system¶ had detected 20,262 suspected cases, 1,332 (7%) of which were culture-confirmed; 16,019 (79%) patients had been hospitalized. Among reported patients with suspected cholera, 11,580 (57%) are males, and the median age is 21 years (ranging from <1 to 100 years). Approximately one third (36%) of patients with suspected cholera are aged <10 years (Table). The highest proportion of suspected cholera cases (20%) and deaths (17%) occurred among children aged 1–4 years (4,009 and 48, respectively).
The epicenter of the outbreak was the greater Port-au-Prince area, located in Ouest Department; as of January 3, based on Haiti’s case-based surveillance system, Port-au-Prince metropolitan area had reported 63% of all suspected cases (12,695) and 51% of all deaths (144) in the country. The peak in suspected cases occurred on November 8, after which case counts have steadily declined. However, V. cholerae transmission continues to occur throughout the country. As of January 3, MSPP had reported confirmed cases in nine of 10 departments (all except Nord-Est), and suspected cases have been reported in all 10 departments (Figure 2). The actual number of incident cases is likely substantially higher than that reported, given that incidence** to date has closely mirrored reporting from cholera treatment centers, and 79% of all patients with suspected cholera have been hospitalized. This indicates that occurrence of community-based surveillance is limited, which could hinder the ability to detect cholera cases that can propagate transmission.

Public Health Response
CDC is working closely with MSPP, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and implementing partners (including MSF and the Pan American Health Organization) to further expand epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance to guide ongoing response needs. These include improving data collection and ensuring that a sufficient number of cholera treatments centers, beds for patient care, and oral rehydration points are available, to reduce morbidity and mortality. Support is also being provided to departmental health directorates to implement local investigations and response activities to contain cholera in areas of high transmission. Efforts are underway to improve access to WASH services and to support risk communication and community engagement nationwide to interrupt community transmission of cholera throughout Haiti. Support was also provided to launch an OCV campaign in mid-December in high-transmission areas.

Discussion
The first cholera outbreak in Haiti was reported in October 2010, 10 months after the catastrophic earthquake that killed >200,000 persons and displaced >1 million. The 2010 outbreak resulted in >820,000 cases and approximately 10,000 deaths (1,2). Nearly 12 years after the outbreak began, Haiti was declared cholera-free on February 4, 2022, after 3 years without a confirmed case (1). Haiti is currently experiencing a resurgence of cholera that affects all parts of the country. The ongoing social unrest has negatively affected public health infrastructure, creating an environment that has facilitated the current resurgence and associated high mortality across the country. In addition, recent fuel shortages have hindered water treatment efforts and other cholera response activities nationwide. These factors have reduced the supply of safe drinking water, forcing an increasing number of residents to rely on unsafe sources and untreated water, substantially worsening the cholera outbreak and hindering the response (5,6).
Cholera outbreaks, especially in the setting of a complex humanitarian crisis, can spread rapidly, result in many deaths, and quickly become a public health crisis. Mild cases that are not seen in health care facilities can propagate transmission; thus, their detection is critical for monitoring and controlling transmission. Prompt and effective treatment for patients with cholera can reduce mortality rates from >50% to <1% (6,7). Primary treatment includes rehydration therapy (prompt restoration of lost fluids and salts); antibiotic treatment is recommended for severe cholera cases only (8). A CFR of <1% is the goal for case management interventions. Recent peaks in the 14-day CFR at the beginning of December and January might be elevated because of recent receipts of large numbers of backlogged death reports and because of safety and security concerns making community-based surveillance challenging, thereby limiting the detection of less severe cases of cholera. Efforts to control the outbreak and reduce CFRs should include a combination of surveillance, WASH services, risk communication and community engagement, timely treatment of illness, and OCVs. According to WHO’s position paper on cholera vaccines, OCVs should be used in humanitarian crises with high risk for cholera, during a cholera outbreak, and in places with endemic cholera, always in conjunction with other cholera prevention and control strategies (9).
The resurgence of cholera in Haiti and the complexity of the response present significant challenges. However, the existing technical capacity in Haiti, which was built during the previous cholera response, has provided valuable experience and staffing resources to combat cholera. Lessons learned about how to treat and prevent cholera from the previous response should be leveraged to aggressively respond to this outbreak and ensure effective public health actions. Although cases have declined, a multipronged approach including strengthened surveillance, timely case management, targeted OCV campaigns, risk communication, community engagement, and access to safe WASH services and emergency water treatment are urgently needed.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
During the 2020–21 school year, national coverage with state-required vaccines among kindergarten students declined from 95% to approximately 94%.
What is added by this report?
During the 2021–22 school year, coverage decreased again to approximately 93% for all state-required vaccines. The exemption rate remained low (2.6%). An additional start highlight4.4end highlight% without an exemption were not up to date with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Despite widespread return to in-person learning, COVID-19–related disruptions continued to affect vaccination coverage and assessment for the 2021–22 school year, preventing a return to prepandemic coverage.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increasing follow-up with undervaccinated students to reduce the impact of disruptions on vaccination coverage can help protect students from vaccine-preventable diseases.

State and local school vaccination requirements protect students and communities against vaccine-preventable diseases (1). This report summarizes data collected by state and local immunization programs* on vaccination coverage and exemptions to vaccination among children in kindergarten in 49 states† and the District of Columbia and provisional enrollment or grace period status for kindergartners in 27 states§ for the 2021–22 school year. Nationwide, vaccination coverage with 2 doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) was start highlight93.0end highlight%¶; with the state-required number of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) doses was start highlight92.7%**; with poliovirus vaccine (polio) was start highlight93.1end highlight%††; and with the state-required number of varicella vaccine doses was 92.8%.§§ Compared with the 2020–21 school year, vaccination coverage decreased start highlight0.8–0.9end highlight percentage points for all vaccines. Although 2.6% of kindergartners had an exemption for at least one vaccine,¶¶ an additional start highlight4.4end highlight% who did not have an exemption were not up to date with MMR. Although there has been a nearly complete return to in-person learning after COVID-19 pandemic-associated disruptions, immunization programs continued to report COVID-19–related impacts on vaccination assessment and coverage. Follow-up with undervaccinated students and catch-up campaigns remain important for increasing vaccination coverage to prepandemic levels to protect children and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases.
As mandated by state and local school entry requirements, parents provide children’s vaccination or exemption documentation to schools, or schools obtain records from state immunization information systems. Federally funded immunization programs work with departments of education, school nurses, and other school personnel to assess vaccination and exemption status of children enrolled in public and private kindergartens and to report unweighted counts, aggregated by school type, to CDC via a web-based questionnaire in the Secure Access Management system, a federal, web-based system that provides authorized personnel with secure access to public health applications operated by CDC. CDC uses these counts to produce state- and national-level estimates of vaccination coverage among children in kindergarten. During the 2021–22 school year, 49 states and the District of Columbia reported coverage with all state-required vaccines and exemption data for public school kindergartners; 48 states and the District of Columbia reported coverage with all state-required vaccines and exemption data for private school kindergartners.*** Data from cities were included with their state data. State-level coverage and national and median coverage with the state-required number of DTaP, MMR, polio, and varicella vaccine doses are reported. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage is not included in this report but is available at SchoolVaxView (2). Twenty-seven states reported the number of kindergartners who were attending school under a grace period (attendance without proof of complete vaccination or exemption during a set interval) or provisional enrollment (school attendance while completing a catch-up vaccination schedule). All counts were current as of the time of the assessment.††† National estimates, medians, and summary measures include only U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
Vaccination coverage and exemption estimates were adjusted on the basis of survey type and response rate.§§§ National estimates measure coverage and exemptions among all kindergartners, whereas medians indicate the midpoint of state-level coverage, irrespective of population size. During the 2021–22 school year, immunization programs reported start highlight3,835,130end highlight children enrolled in kindergarten in 49 states and the District of Columbia.¶¶¶ Reported estimates are based on start highlight3,536,546end highlight (92.2%) children who were surveyed for vaccination coverage, start highlight3,686,775 (96.1%)end highlight surveyed for exemptions, and start highlight2,527,578 (65.9%)end highlight surveyed for grace period and provisional enrollment status. Potentially achievable coverage with MMR (the sum of the percentage of children who were up to date with 2 doses of MMR and those not up to date but with no documented vaccination exemption) was calculated for each state. Nonexempt students include those who were provisionally enrolled in kindergarten, in a grace period, or otherwise without documentation of complete vaccination. SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for all analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.****
Vaccination assessments varied by state because of differences in required vaccines and required numbers of doses, vaccines assessed, methods of data collection, and data reported (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/123203). Kindergartners were considered up to date with a given vaccine if they received all doses required for school entry, except in eight states†††† that reported kindergartners as up to date for any vaccine only if they had received all doses of all vaccines required for school entry. States were asked to report any COVID-19–related impact on kindergarten vaccination measurement and coverage through a combination of structured responses and open-ended questions.
Nationally, 2-dose MMR coverage was start highlight93.0end highlight% (range = 78.0% [Alaska] to start highlight≥98.6% [Mississippi]end highlight), with coverage of ≥95% reported by start highlight14end highlight states and <90% by nine states and the District of Columbia (Table). DTaP coverage was start highlight92.7end highlight% (range = 78.0% [Alaska] to start highlight≥≥≥98.6% [Mississippi]end highlight); coverage of ≥95% was reported by start highlight15end highlight states and of <90% by 12 states and the District of Columbia. Polio vaccination coverage was start highlight93.1end highlight% (range = 77.1% [Alaska] to start highlight≥98.6% [Mississippi]end highlight), with coverage of ≥95% reported by start highlight14end highlight states and <90% by 10 states and the District of Columbia. Varicella vaccination coverage nationally was 92.8% (range = 76.1% [Alaska] to start highlight≥98.6% [Mississippi]end highlight), with start highlight13end highlight states reporting coverage ≥95% and nine states and the District of Columbia reporting <90% coverage. Coverage decreased in most states for all vaccines compared with the 2020–21 school year (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/123205).
Overall, 2.6% of kindergartners had an exemption (0.2% medical and 2.3% nonmedical§§§§) for one or more required vaccines (not limited to MMR, DTaP, polio, and varicella vaccines) in 2021–22 (range = 0.1% [Mississippi, New York, and West Virginia] to 9.8% [Idaho]), compared with 2.2% reported during the 2020–21 school year (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/123204). Among 27 states reporting data on provisional kindergarten enrollment or grace period attendance, 2.4% of children were so enrolled (range = <0.1% [Hawaii] to 8.5% [Wisconsin]).
Nationally, MMR coverage for both the 2020–21 and 2021–22 school years was lower than that reported since 2013–14 (Figure 1). Nationwide, start highlight4.4end highlight% of kindergarten students were not fully vaccinated and not exempt. Among the start highlight35end highlight states and the District of Columbia with MMR coverage <95%, all but four could potentially achieve ≥95% MMR coverage if all nonexempt kindergartners who were within a grace period, provisionally enrolled, or otherwise enrolled in school without documentation of vaccination were vaccinated (Figure 2).
Twenty-three states reported COVID-19–related impacts on data collection including lower response rates from schools, data collection extensions and delays, and incomplete data from schools that did respond; 30 states reported lingering COVID-19–related impacts on vaccination coverage, mostly related to reduced access to vaccination appointments and local or school level extensions of grace period or provisional enrollment policies (CDC, School Vaccination Coverage Report, unpublished data, 2022).

Discussion
During the 2021–22 school year, coverage with MMR, DTaP, polio, and varicella vaccines among kindergarten children was approximately 93% nationwide for each vaccine, lower than the 94% coverage reported during the 2020–21 school year, and the 95% coverage reported during the 2019–20 school year, when children were vaccinated before the pandemic (2,3). Coverage with all four vaccines declined in most states. National MMR coverage among kindergarten students remained below the Healthy People 2030 target of 95% (4) for the second consecutive year. These findings are consistent with those of continuing declines in routine childhood and adolescent vaccine administration through March 2021 (5). MMR coverage of start highlight93.0end highlight% translates to start highlightapproximatelyend highlight 250,000 kindergartners who are potentially not protected against measles; clusters of unvaccinated and undervaccinated children can lead to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
The overall percentage of children with an exemption remained low during the 2021–22 school year at 2.6%, although the percentage of children with exemptions increased in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Nationwide, start highlight4.4end highlight% of kindergarten students were not fully vaccinated with MMR and not exempt, and this percentage increased in most states compared with 2020–21. Nonexempt undervaccinated students often attend school while in a grace period or are provisionally enrolled; in many states, these policies were expanded either formally or informally during the 2020–21 school year, and this expansion continued to a lesser extent during the 2021–22 school year, even as most schools returned to in-person classes. States continued to report COVID-19–related impacts on vaccination coverage and assessment activities.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, comparisons among states are limited because of variation in states’ requirements such as which vaccines are required, the number of doses required, the date required, and the type of documentation accepted; data collection methods; allowable exemptions; and definitions of grace period and provisional enrollment. Second, representativeness might be negatively affected by data collection methods that assess vaccination status at different times or miss some schools or students, such as those who are homeschooled. Third, vaccination coverage, exemption rates, or both, might be underestimated or overestimated because of inaccurate or absent documentation or missing schools. Fourth, national coverage estimates for the 2021–22 school year include only 49 of 50 states and the District of Columbia and use lower bound estimates for eight states; exemption estimates include 49 states and the District of Columbia and use lower bound estimates for five states, and grace period or provisional enrollment estimates include only 27 states. Finally, states continued to report that the COVID-19 pandemic response created various barriers that limited the amount and quality of student vaccination data collected and reported by local health departments.
Vaccination coverage among kindergarten students remains below prepandemic levels; pockets of undervaccinated children within larger areas of high vaccination coverage can lead to outbreaks (6–8). Immunization programs can use local-level data, such as that from school assessments or immunization information systems, to identify schools or communities with low vaccination coverage. Rigorously enforced school vaccination requirements, school-based vaccination clinics, reminder and recall systems, and follow-up with undervaccinated students by school nurses are effective strategies to improve vaccination coverage (9,10). As schools return to in-person learning, high vaccination coverage is critical to continue protecting children and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases.

* Federally funded immunization programs are located in 50 states and the District of Columbia, five cities, and eight U.S territories and freely associated states. Two cities reported data, which were also included in data submitted by their state, to CDC. State-level data were used to calculate national estimates and medians. Immunization programs in territories reported vaccination coverage and exemptions; however, these data were not included in national calculations.
† Montana did not report school vaccination data.
§ Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming reported data on the number of students within a grace period or provisionally enrolled at the time of assessment.
¶ All states require 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine. Seven states (Alaska, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Virginia) require only 1 dose of rubella vaccine. Alaska, New Jersey, and Oregon require only 1 dose of mumps vaccine; mumps vaccine is not required in Iowa.
** Nebraska requires 3 doses of DTaP, Maryland and Wisconsin require 4 doses, and all other states require 5 doses, unless dose 4 was administered on or after the fourth birthday. The reported coverage estimates represent the percentage of kindergartners with the state-required number of DTaP doses, except for Kentucky, which requires 5 doses of DTaP by age 5 years but reported 4-dose coverage for kindergartners.
†† Two states (Maryland and Nebraska) require only 3 doses of polio vaccine; all other states require 4 doses unless the last dose was given on or after the fourth birthday.
§§ Five states require 1 dose of varicella vaccine; 44 states and the District of Columbia require 2 doses.
¶¶ Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri did not report the number of kindergartners with an exemption but instead reported the number of exemptions for each vaccine, which could have counted some children more than once. For these states, the percentage of kindergartners exempt from the vaccine with the highest number of exemptions by exemption type (the lower bound of the potential range of exemptions) was included in the national and median exemption rates.
*** Twelve states reported coverage and exemption data for at least some homeschooled kindergartners, either separately or included with data from public or private schools.
††† Assessment date varied by state and area. Three states assessed schools on the first day of school; 10 states assessed schools by December 31; 18 states and the District of Columbia assessed schools by some other date, ranging from October 15, 2021, to June 23, 2022; and 18 states assessed schools on a rolling basis.
§§§ Immunization programs that used census or voluntary response provided CDC with data aggregated at the state or local (city or territory) level. Estimates based on these data were adjusted for nonresponse using the inverse of the response rate, stratified by school type (public, private, and homeschool, where available). Programs that used complex sample surveys provided CDC with data aggregated at the school or county level for weighted analysis. Weights were calculated to account for sample design and adjusted for nonresponse.
¶¶¶ These totals are the summations of the kindergartners surveyed among programs reporting data for coverage, exemptions, grace periods, and provisional enrollment. Data from cities and territories were not included in these totals.

†††† Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Wisconsin considered kindergartners up to date only if they had received all doses of all vaccines required for school entry. In Kentucky, public schools reported numbers of children up to date with specific vaccines and most private schools reported numbers of children who received all doses of all vaccines required for school entry.
§§§§ Washington was unable to deduplicate data for students with both religious and philosophical exemptions; therefore, the nonmedical exemption type with the highest number of kindergartners (the lower bound of the potential range of nonmedical exemptions) was included in the national and median exemption rates for nonmedical exemptions.

* Estimates adjusted for nonresponse and weighted for sampling where appropriate.
† Estimates based on a completed vaccination series (i.e., not vaccine specific) use the “≥” symbol. Coverage might include history of disease or laboratory evidence of immunity. In Kentucky, public schools reported numbers of children up to date with specific vaccines, and most private schools reported numbers of children who received all doses of all vaccines required for school entry.
§ A grace period is a set number of days during which a student can be enrolled and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or exemption. Provisional enrollment allows a student without complete vaccination or exemption to attend school while completing a catch-up vaccination schedule. In states with one or both of these policies, the estimates represent the number of kindergartners who were within a grace period, were provisionally enrolled, or were in a combination of these categories.
¶ Some programs did not report the number of children with exemptions, but instead reported the number of exemptions for each vaccine, which could count some children more than once. Lower bounds of the percentage of children with any exemptions were estimated using the individual vaccines with the highest number of exemptions. Estimates based on vaccine-specific exemptions use the “≥” symbol.
** Exemptions, grace period or provisional enrollment, and vaccine coverage status might not be mutually exclusive. Some children enrolled under a grace period or provisional enrollment might be exempt from one or more vaccinations, and children with exemptions might be fully vaccinated with one or more required vaccines.
†† Includes five territories and three freely associated states.
§§ The kindergarten population is an approximation provided by each program.
¶¶ The number surveyed represents the number surveyed for coverage. Exemption estimates are based on 29,010 kindergartners for Kansas, 58,276 for South Carolina, and 92,265 for Virginia.
*** Most states require 2 doses of MMR; Alaska, New Jersey, and Oregon require 2 doses of measles, 1 dose of mumps, and 1 dose of rubella vaccines. Georgia, New York, New York City, North Carolina, and Virginia require 2 doses of measles and mumps vaccines and 1 dose of rubella vaccine. Iowa requires 2 doses of measles vaccine and 2 doses of rubella vaccine.
††† Pertussis vaccination coverage might include some DTP doses if administered in another country or by a vaccination provider who continued to use DTP after 2000. Most states require 5 doses of DTaP for school entry, or 4 doses if the fourth dose was received on or after the fourth birthday; Maryland and Wisconsin require 4 doses; Nebraska requires 3 doses. The reported coverage estimates represent the percentage of kindergartners with the state-required number of DTaP doses, except for Kentucky, which requires ≥5 but reports ≥4 doses of DTaP.
§§§ Most states require 4 doses of polio for school entry, or 3 doses if the fourth dose was received on or after the fourth birthday; Maryland and Nebraska require 3 doses. The reported coverage estimates represent the percentage of kindergartners with the state-required number of polio doses, except for Kentucky, which requires ≥4 but reports ≥3 doses of polio.
¶¶¶ Most states require 2 doses of VAR for school entry; Alabama, Arizona, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Oregon require 1 dose. Reporting of VAR status for kindergartners with a history of varicella disease varied within and among states; some kindergartners were reported as vaccinated against varicella and others as medically exempt.
**** National coverage estimates and medians were calculated using data from 49 states (i.e., do not include Montana) and the District of Columbia. National grace period or provisional enrollment estimates and median were calculated using data from the 27 states that have either a grace period or provisional enrollment policy and reported relevant data to CDC. National exemption estimate and median were calculated from data from 49 states (i.e., did not include Montana) and the District of Columbia.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine vaccination against 14 diseases during the first 24 months of life.
What is added by this report?
Vaccination coverage among young children has remained high and stable for most vaccines, although disparities persist. The National Immunization Survey–Child identified no decline overall in routine vaccination coverage associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among children born during 2018–2019, although declines were observed among children living below the federal poverty level and in rural areas.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Additional efforts, such as providers reviewing children’s immunization histories during every clinical encounter, recommending needed vaccinations, and addressing parental hesitancy, are warranted to reduce disparities so that all children can be protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.

Millions of young children are vaccinated safely in the United States each year against a variety of potentially dangerous infectious diseases (1). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination against 14 diseases during the first 24 months of life* (2). This report describes vaccination coverage by age 24 months using data from the National Immunization Survey–Child (NIS-Child).† Compared with coverage among children born during 2016–2017, coverage among children born during 2018–2019 increased for a majority of recommended vaccines. Coverage was >90% for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (93.4%), ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) (92.7%), ≥1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) (91.6%), and ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine (VAR) (91.1%); coverage was lowest for ≥2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) (47.3%). Vaccination coverage overall was similar or higher among children reaching age 24 months during March 2020 or later (during the COVID-19 pandemic) than among those reaching age 24 months before March 2020 (prepandemic); however, coverage with the combined 7-vaccine series§ among children living below the federal poverty level or in rural areas decreased by 4–5 percentage points during the pandemic (3). Among children born during 2018–2019, coverage disparities were observed by race and ethnicity, poverty status, health insurance status, and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) residence. Coverage was typically higher among privately insured children than among children with other insurance or no insurance. Persistent disparities by health insurance status indicate the need to improve access to vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program.¶ Providers should review children’s histories and recommend needed vaccinations during every clinical encounter and address parental hesitancy to help reduce disparities and ensure that all children are protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.
NIS-Child is a random-digit–dialed survey of households that includes children aged 19–35 months. Parents or guardians complete a telephone survey,** and consent to contact the child’s vaccination providers is requested. With parental or guardian consent, identified providers are mailed a questionnaire to obtain vaccination information, which is synthesized to create the child’s comprehensive vaccination history. Children born during 2018–2019 were identified from data collected during 2019–2021, resulting in 29,598 children with adequate provider data†† for analysis. The 2021 household response rate§§ was 22.9%, and adequate provider data were obtained from 51.5% of households with completed interviews. Vaccination coverage by age 24 months was estimated using Kaplan-Meier techniques, except for the birth dose of HepB¶¶ and rotavirus vaccine.*** Coverage with ≥2 doses of HepA was also estimated by age 35 months (the maximum age available).††† Significance of coverage differences was assessed using z-tests; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses used weighted data and were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SUDAAN (version 11; RTI International). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§

National Vaccination Coverage
Among children born during 2018–2019, vaccination coverage by age 24 months increased compared with that among children born during 2016–2017 for a majority of vaccines (Table 1). Coverage was >90% for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (93.4%), ≥1 dose of MMR (91.6%), ≥3 doses of HepB (92.7), and ≥1 dose of VAR (91.1%). The only vaccines for which coverage was <70% were ≥2 doses of HepA (47.3%) and ≥2 doses of influenza vaccine (63.9%). The proportion of children who received no vaccinations by age 24 months decreased from 1.3% among those born during 2016–2017 to 0.9% among those born during 2018–2019. Coverage by birth year during 2011–2019 was stable for a majority of vaccines, with increases during recent years for the HepB birth dose, rotavirus vaccine, ≥2 influenza vaccine doses, and ≥2 HepA doses by age 35 months (Figure).

Vaccination by Selected Sociodemographic Characteristics and Geographic Locations
Among children born during 2018–2019, coverage among those who were uninsured and those insured by Medicaid or other insurance¶¶¶ was lower than that among privately insured children for all vaccines except the HepB birth dose, which was lower among uninsured children only (Table 2). The proportion of children who were unvaccinated by age 24 months was eight times higher for uninsured compared with privately insured children. Compared with non-Hispanic White children, coverage with a majority of vaccines was lower among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) children, and coverage with ≥1 MMR dose, ≥1 VAR dose, rotavirus vaccine, ≥2 influenza vaccine doses, and the 7-vaccine series was lower among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) children (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/123206). Coverage was lower among children living below the poverty level than among those living at or above the poverty level for all vaccines except the HepB birth dose (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/123207). Coverage with all vaccines except for the HepB birth dose was lower among children living in a non-MSA**** compared with those in an MSA principal city. Vaccination coverage varied widely by jurisdiction (Supplementary Table 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/123208), especially coverage with ≥2 influenza vaccine doses, which ranged from 39.7% (Alabama) to 84.0% (Rhode Island).

Discussion
U.S. coverage with most recommended childhood vaccines has remained high and stable for many years. Increases in coverage by age 24 months were observed for most vaccines when comparing children born during 2018–2019 with those born during 2016–2017. Approximately 70% of children born in recent years (2016–2019) were up to date with the 7-vaccine series by age 24 months, with coverage >70% for all other vaccines except for ≥2 influenza vaccine doses and ≥2 doses of HepA. The proportion of children completely unvaccinated by age 24 months was 0.9% for children born during 2018–2019, meeting the Healthy People 2030†††† objective of <1.3%.
This report did not identify any overall decline in vaccination coverage associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among all children. The youngest children were born in 2019. These children reached age 12 months in 2020 and 24 months in 2021; therefore, many of these children had vaccine doses recommended after the pandemic was declared in March 2020. In a more detailed analysis, coverage with the combined 7-vaccine series by age 24 months decreased 4–5 percentage points among children living below the federal poverty level or in rural areas (3). In addition, MMR coverage was 10 percentage points lower for children reaching age 13 months during April–May 2020 compared with those reaching age 13 months before and after this time frame, but coverage reached prepandemic levels by age 19 months (3). Similar decreases in coverage were observed in other data sources (4). The 2022 NIS-Child will include more children born shortly before or during the pandemic, providing a more complete assessment of trends in vaccination coverage during the pandemic.
Vaccination coverage declined for children living below the federal poverty level or in rural areas during the pandemic, and substantial variation in coverage by sociodemographic characteristics persists. As observed elsewhere (4), estimated coverage was highest among Asian children and lowest among Black children. Lower coverage was found among children living below the federal poverty level, without private health insurance, and in rural (non-MSA) areas.
If equity is to be achieved in the national childhood vaccination program, a number of obstacles must be overcome. Parents and other caregivers must have the willingness and the means to get children vaccinated. A recent report estimated that 6.5%–31.3% of nonvaccination among children could be attributed to parental hesitancy, depending upon the vaccine (5). CDC has developed a Vaccinate with Confidence strategy for identifying activities designed to bolster vaccine confidence and prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (6). Several additional evidence-based approaches to increasing vaccination coverage include strong health care provider recommendations, advocating for vaccines at every health care encounter, use of reminder and recall notices and standing orders, and the presence of state and local immunization information systems to provide consolidated immunization histories (7).
Logistical and financial barriers also must be addressed. The VFC program covers the cost of all recommended vaccines for eligible children; it is imperative that this program retain an adequate supply of participating vaccination providers and that families in need are aware of how to access it. Establishment of alternative vaccination settings such as pharmacies, emergency departments, hospitals, and outpatient subspecialty clinics might help address accessibility issues for underserved communities (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the possibility of selection bias exists because of the low household interview response rate (ranging from 21%–26% during survey years 2017–2021) and the availability of adequate provider data for 49%–54% of those who completed interviews in survey years 2017–2021. Second, although the data were weighted to account for nonresponse and households without telephones, some bias could remain. Finally, coverage estimates could be incorrect if some vaccination providers did not return questionnaires or if administered vaccines were not documented accurately. Total survey error (9) for the 2021 survey year data was assessed and demonstrated that coverage was underestimated by 3.1 percentage points for ≥1 dose of MMR, 4.4 percentage points for the HepB birth dose, and 8.7 percentage points for the combined -vaccine series. An analysis of change in bias of vaccination coverage estimates from 2020 to 2021 determined that a meaningful change was unlikely.§§§§
At the national level, coverage with most routine childhood vaccines is high; however, this high coverage is not distributed uniformly: coverage is lower among Black and Hispanic children, those of lower socioeconomic status, and those living in rural areas. Recent measles outbreaks¶¶¶¶ and the diagnosis of a case of polio (10) serve as reminders that pockets of susceptibility can and do exist, even in a largely well-vaccinated society. Parents and providers must remain vigilant to ensure that all children are up to date with their routine vaccinations to protect them from vaccine-preventable diseases.

* Vaccination against COVID-19 was recommended for children aged 6 months–4 years in June 2022 (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/covid-19-moderna-pfizer-children-vaccine-etr.html). Children in this report were either aged >4 years during June 2022 (some were eligible for COVID-19 vaccine at age ≥5 years, but vaccine history was not ascertained past age 35 months), or data on vaccine histories were collected before 2022.
† Estimates for U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regions, states, selected local areas, and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico can be found online (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/childvaxview/data-reports/index.html). Certain local areas that receive federal Section 317 immunization funds are sampled separately and included in the NIS-Child sample every year (Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania; Bexar County, Texas; and Houston, Texas). National estimates in this report exclude territories.
§ The combined 7-vaccine series (4:3:1:3*:3:1:4) includes ≥4 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine; ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine; ≥1 dose of measles-containing vaccine; ≥3 or ≥4 doses (depending upon product type) of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine; ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine; ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine; and ≥4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
¶ Eligible children include those aged ≤18 years who are Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, American Indian or Alaska Native, or insured by health plans that do not fully cover routine immunization (if vaccination is received at a Federally Qualified Health Center or a rural health clinic). https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/
** NIS-Child used a landline-only sampling frame during 1995–2010. During 2011–2017, the survey was conducted using a dual-frame design, with both mobile and landline sampling frames included. During 2018, NIS-Child returned to a single-frame design, with all interviews conducted by mobile telephone.
†† Children with at least one vaccination reported by a provider and those who had received no vaccinations were considered to have adequate provider data. “No vaccinations” indicates that the vaccination status is known because the parent or guardian indicated there were no vaccinations and the providers returned no immunization history forms or returned them indicating that no vaccinations had been administered.
§§ The Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) household response rate is calculated as the product of the resolution rate (percentage of the total telephone numbers called that were classified as nonworking, nonresidential, or residential), screening completion rate (percentage of known households that were successfully screened for the presence of age-eligible children), and the interview completion rate (percentage of households with one or more age-eligible children that completed the household survey). The CASRO household response rate is equivalent to the American Association for Public Opinion Research type 3 response rate (https://www-archive.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/publications/Standard-Definitions20169theditionfinal.pdf). CASRO response rates and the proportions of children with household interviews that had adequate provider data for survey years 2015–2020 are available online. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/downloads/NIS-PUF20-DUG.pdf
¶¶ The birth dose of HepB is measured as the proportion of children who received a dose of HepB by age 3 days.
*** Rotavirus is assessed at age 8 months to reflect the maximum age at administration recommended by ACIP.
††† Children waiting 12–18 months to receive the second dose of HepA might receive it during the beginning of the catch-up period, which starts at age 24 months.

¶¶¶ “Other insurance” includes the Children’s Health Insurance Program, military insurance, coverage via the Indian Health Service, and any other type of health insurance not mentioned elsewhere.
**** MSA status was determined based on household reported city and county of residence and was grouped into three categories: MSA principal city, MSA nonprincipal city, and non-MSA. MSAs and principal cities were as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro.html). Non-MSA areas include urban populations not located within an MSA and completely rural areas.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
After CDC’s October 2022 recommendation for bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccination for children aged 5–11 years, children in this age group received approximately 953,359 bivalent booster doses during October 12, 2022–January 1, 2023.
What is added by this report?
Early safety findings from v-safe and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for bivalent booster vaccination in children aged 5–11 years are similar to those described for monovalent booster vaccination. Most VAERS reports represented vaccine errors rather than adverse events. Neither myocarditis nor death were reported after bivalent booster vaccination.
What are the implications for public health practice?
These preliminary safety findings should be provided when counseling parents or guardians about bivalent booster vaccination. All eligible persons should receive a bivalent booster dose.

On October 12, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for bivalent (mRNA encoding the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and BA.4/BA.5 Omicron variants) formulations of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for use as a single booster dose ≥2 months after completion of primary series or monovalent booster vaccination for children aged 5–11 years (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 6–17 years (Moderna); on December 8, 2022, FDA amended the EUAs to include children aged ≥6 months (1,2). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months receive an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA booster dose (3). The safety of bivalent mRNA booster doses among persons aged ≥12 years has previously been described (4). To characterize the safety of bivalent mRNA booster doses among children aged 5–11 years after receipt of bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna booster doses, CDC reviewed adverse events and health impacts reported to v-safe,* a voluntary, smartphone-based U.S. safety surveillance system established by CDC to monitor adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, and to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a U.S. passive vaccine safety surveillance system co-managed by CDC and FDA† (5). During October 12–January 1, 2023, a total of 861,251 children aged 5–11 years received a bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster, and 92,108 children aged 6–11 years received a bivalent Moderna booster.§ Among 3,259 children aged 5–11 years registered in v-safe who received a bivalent booster dose, local (68.7%) and systemic reactions (49.5%) were commonly reported in the week after vaccination. Approximately 99.8% of reports to VAERS for children aged 5–11 years after bivalent booster vaccination were nonserious. There were no reports of myocarditis or death after bivalent booster vaccination. Eighty-four percent of VAERS reports were related to vaccination errors, 90.5% of which did not list an adverse health event. Local and systemic reactions reported after receipt of a bivalent booster dose are consistent with those reported after a monovalent booster dose; serious adverse events are rare. Vaccine providers should provide this information when counseling parents or guardians about bivalent booster vaccination. Preliminary safety findings from the first 11 weeks of bivalent booster vaccination among children aged 5–11 years are reassuring. Compared with the low risk of serious health effects after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, the health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection include death and serious long-term sequalae (6). ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months receive an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA booster dose ≥2 months after completion of a COVID-19 primary series or receipt of a monovalent booster dose.¶
A parent or guardian with a v-safe account can register a child aged <15 years and complete health surveys on behalf of the child.** Health surveys sent daily during the week after vaccination ask questions about local injection site and systemic reactions and health impacts experienced; registrants can provide additional information about these reactions or health impacts via free text responses. CDC’s v-safe call center personnel contact registrants who report receiving medical care to request further information; registrants are also encouraged to complete a VAERS report, if indicated.
VAERS accepts reports of postvaccination adverse events from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public.†† Providers in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program are required to file VAERS reports for observed adverse events after vaccination and for vaccination errors. Signs, symptoms, and diagnoses reported to VAERS are assigned Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms (MedDRA PTs) by VAERS personnel.§§ Death certificates and autopsy reports are requested for any reported death.
A bivalent booster dose in v-safe was defined as administration of an age-appropriate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose on or after October 12, 2022, to a registrant who had completed at least a primary vaccination series (2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine). In this report, local and systemic reactions and health impacts reported during the week after vaccination were described for v-safe registrants aged 5–11 years who received a bivalent booster dose during October 12–January 1, 2023. VAERS adverse event reports were described by serious and nonserious classification, demographic characteristics, and MedDRA PTs. Reports of serious events to VAERS were reviewed by CDC physicians to form a consensus on clinical impression based on available data.¶¶ Possible cases of myocarditis, a rare adverse event that has been associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, were identified using selected MedDRA PTs (6). All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). These surveillance activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***

Review of v-safe Data
During October 12–January 1, 2023, a total of 3,259 v-safe registrants aged 5–11 years received an age-appropriate bivalent booster dose (Table 1); 2,647 (81.2%) received Pfizer-BioNTech, and 612 (18.8%) received Moderna bivalent booster doses. Approximately 20.6% (670) of registrants received at least one other vaccination at the same visit as bivalent booster vaccination; among these, 649 (96.9%) received an influenza vaccine.
On ≥1 day during the week after receipt of the bivalent booster dose, local injection site reactions were reported for 1,740 (65.7%) Pfizer-BioNTech recipients and 470 (76.8%) Moderna recipients (Table 2); systemic reactions were reported for 1,215 (45.9%) Pfizer-BioNTech recipients and 379 (61.9%) Moderna recipients. The most commonly reported adverse reactions after receipt of either vaccine were injection site pain (2,146; 65.9%), fatigue (1,076; 33.0%), and headache (745; 22.9%). Most reported reactions were mild in severity (noticeable, but not problematic). Reactions were most frequently reported the day after vaccination; reporting frequency decreased in the days that followed. At least 1 day during the week after bivalent booster vaccination, 469 (14.4%) children were reported to be unable to attend school, and 447 (13.7%) were unable to complete daily activities. Sixty-two (1.9%) parents or guardians reported seeking medical care for their child after bivalent booster vaccination, most commonly in an outpatient clinic (37; 1.1%); no children received hospital care. Of the 64 reports of medical care sought, 37 had additional information available; parents or guardians of 35 children reported that seeking care was unrelated to vaccination.

Review of VAERS Data
During October 12–January 1, 2023, VAERS received and processed 922 reports of adverse events among children aged 5–11 years (Table 3).††† The median recipient age was 9 years (range = 5–11 years), and 459 (49.8%) reports were for females. Approximately 13.4% (124) of registrants received at least one other vaccination during that same visit; of those, 115 (92.7%) received an influenza vaccine. Among all 922 VAERS reports, 920 (99.8%) were classified as nonserious, 845 (99.8%) after Pfizer-BioNTech and 75 (100%) after Moderna bivalent booster vaccination.
The most common events reported (775; 84.2%) were vaccination errors (e.g., incorrect dose administered [303; 39.1%], incorrect product formulation administered [207; 26.7%], product preparation issue [177; 22.8%], and product administered to patient of an inappropriate age [126; 16.3%]). Reports assigned the MedDRA PTs “incorrect dose administered,” “incorrect product formulation administered,” or “product administered to patient of inappropriate age” often represented situations in which a child received an adult bivalent booster dosage or a bivalent booster dose instead of the appropriate monovalent primary series dose. Reports assigned the MedDRA PT “product preparation issue” often represented situations in which vaccine was incorrectly reconstituted. Among 775 reports of vaccination errors related to bivalent booster vaccination, 74 (9.5%) reports indicated that an adverse health event had occurred.
After excluding vaccination error reports, 145 (15.8%) of the 920 nonserious reports remained. Commonly reported events included fever (21; 14.5%), syncope (20; 13.8%), vomiting (18; 12.4%), nausea (17; 11.7%), and dizziness (14; 9.7%). Two serious reports were for children who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine; one for a child who developed symptoms consistent with Miller Fisher syndrome, a rare, acquired neurologic condition considered to be a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome§§§; verification based on medical record review is pending. The other one was for a child hospitalized with urticaria and arthritis. No reports of myocarditis or death after bivalent booster vaccination were received.

Discussion
This report provides findings from v-safe and VAERS data collected during the first 11 weeks of bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA booster dose administration among children aged 5–11 years; during this period, approximately 953,359 booster doses were administered to children in this age group. The findings in this report are generally consistent with those from postauthorization vaccine safety surveillance of monovalent mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccination in this age group (7).
Reports to v-safe of systemic and injection site reactions after bivalent booster vaccination among children aged 5–11 years were similar in frequency to those reported after monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster vaccination (7). Consistent with previous descriptions of reactogenicity after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (8), reactions and health impacts were reported more frequently for children who received Moderna than for those who received Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster vaccination. Most reports to v-safe of children who received medical care after bivalent booster vaccination indicated that care was not related to vaccination.
After administration of >950,000 doses of bivalent booster vaccine to children aged 5-11 years, only two serious VAERS reports have been received. Approximately 99.8% of reports to VAERS for children aged 5–11 years after bivalent booster vaccination were deemed nonserious; most (85.0%) reports were related to vaccination errors. Many vaccination errors represented children receiving an incorrect bivalent booster dose for their age or an incorrectly reconstituted dose. Most reports of vaccination error did not include an adverse health event; those with an event were consistent with expected reactions after an mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Among events reported to VAERS, vaccination errors were reported with a similar frequency among children aged 5–11 years after monovalent (71%) or bivalent (84%) booster vaccination (7). Vaccination errors represented a smaller proportion of events (35%) reported among persons aged ≥12 years who received bivalent booster vaccination (4). CDC provides updated clinical guidance, educational materials, and training opportunities after each update to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.¶¶¶ Public health officials should continue to provide training materials for vaccine administrators to help reduce vaccination errors among children.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, v-safe is a voluntary program, and data might not be representative of the vaccinated population. Second, v-safe does not directly identify whether a vaccine is monovalent or bivalent; therefore, misclassification might occur among children who aged into this population without having completed a 3-dose primary series. Third, VAERS is a passive surveillance system and subject to reporting biases and underreporting, especially of nonserious events (5). Finally, conclusions drawn from these data are limited by the 11-week surveillance period; safety monitoring will continue during the bivalent booster vaccination program.
ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months receive an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA booster dose ≥2 months after completion of a COVID-19 primary series or receipt of a monovalent booster dose. Preliminary safety findings from the first 11 weeks of bivalent booster vaccination among children aged 5–11 years are reassuring. Compared with the low risk of serious health effects after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, the health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection include death and serious long-term sequalae (6). Immunization with bivalent vaccines provides significant additional protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (9). CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates as needed to help guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.

† Based on an affirmative response to the survey question, “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had hepatitis?” All types and causes of hepatitis could be reported by the respondent.
§ Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.
Top
In 2021, 1.6% of adults aged ≥18 years reported having ever had hepatitis. The prevalence of hepatitis was lowest among adults aged 18–44 years (0.6%) and highest among adults aged ≥65 years (2.7%). Prevalence increased with age for both men and women. The percentage of adults who ever had hepatitis was higher in men than women aged 45–64 years (2.7% versus 1.9%) and ≥65 years (3.2% versus 2.3%) but was similar in adults aged 18–44 years (0.5% versus 0.6%).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Some racial and ethnic groups are at increased risk for COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality because of systemic and structural inequities. Vaccination is effective in preventing severe COVID-19–related outcomes.
What is added by this report?
Among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, ≥1-dose COVID-19 vaccination coverage was low overall, but highest among Asian and Hispanic or Latino children and adolescents. Parental intent to vaccinate their child varied by the child’s age, race, and ethnicity. Parents of unvaccinated children and adolescents reported low confidence in vaccine safety, and a low percentage reported receipt of a provider vaccination recommendation.
What are the implications for public health practice?
To increase overall coverage and address disparities in child and adolescent COVID-19 vaccination coverage, providers and trusted messengers should provide culturally relevant information and vaccine recommendations.

Some racial and ethnic groups are at increased risk for COVID-19 and associated hospitalization and death because of systemic and structural inequities contributing to higher prevalences of high-risk conditions and increased exposure (1). Vaccination is the most effective prevention intervention against COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality*; ensuring more equitable vaccine access is a public health priority. Differences in adult COVID-19 vaccination coverage by race and ethnicity have been previously reported (2,3), but similar information for children and adolescents is limited (4,5). CDC analyzed data from the National Immunization Survey–Child COVID Module (NIS-CCM) to describe racial and ethnic differences in vaccination status, parental intent to vaccinate their child, and behavioral and social drivers of vaccination among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years. By August 31, 2022, approximately one third (33.2%) of children aged 5–11 years, more than one half (59.0%) of children and adolescents aged 12–15 years, and more than two thirds (68.6%) of adolescents aged 16–17 years had received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Vaccination coverage was highest among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) children and adolescents, ranging from 63.4% among those aged 5–11 years to 91.8% among those aged 16–17 years. Coverage was next highest among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) children and adolescents (34.5%–77.3%). Coverage was similar for non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), non-Hispanic White (White), and non-Hispanic other race† or multiple race (other/multiple race) children and adolescents aged 12–15 and 16–17 years. Among children aged 5–11 years, coverage among Black children was lower than that among Hispanic, Asian, and other/multiple race children. Enhanced public health efforts are needed to increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage for all children and adolescents. To address disparities in child and adolescent COVID-19 vaccination coverage, vaccination providers and trusted messengers should provide culturally relevant information and vaccine recommendations and build a higher level of trust among those groups with lower coverage.
NIS-CCM is a nationally representative random-digit–dialed mobile telephone survey of households with children and adolescents aged 6 months–17 years. NIS-CCM interview data collected from 94,838 respondents during September 26, 2021–September 30, 2022,§ were used to assess racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 vaccination coverage, parental intent to vaccinate, and behavioral and social drivers of vaccination among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years. Survey respondents were those who reported being knowledgeable about the child’s or adolescent’s vaccination status (parent). Interviews with parents of an unvaccinated child or adolescent, or a child or adolescent who received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose¶ during December 2020–September 2022 were included. White persons were designated as the referent group for most racial and ethnic comparisons because this group has the largest population size and the most social advantage (6).
Kaplan-Meier estimation methods were used to calculate cumulative ≥1-dose COVID-19 vaccination coverage as of August 31, 2022.** First-dose vaccination month and year were hot deck imputed†† for 20.2% of children and adolescents with parent-reported vaccination but without a vaccination date (7). Differences in ≥1-dose coverage were assessed by race and ethnicity and stratified by sociodemographic subgroups. Pairwise comparisons were conducted to assess differences in ≥1-dose estimates for all races and ethnicities. Survey data during July 1–September 30, 2022,§§ (26,961) were pooled to calculate proportions of children and adolescents who 1) were unvaccinated, but parental intent to vaccinate was ascertained, 2) initiated COVID-19 vaccination (received ≥1 dose), 3) completed the primary series (received ≥2 doses), 4) received a monovalent booster (≥3 doses),¶¶ or 5) had an assessment of behavioral and social drivers of vaccination.*** For all analyses, p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; Research Triangle Institute). Survey weights were used to adjust to the noninstitutionalized U.S. population of children and adolescents and to calibrate to CDC vaccine administration data. The cumulative Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) response rate††† was 18.1%. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§
By August 31, 2022, 33.2%, 59.0%, and 68.6% of persons aged 5–11, 12–15, and 16–17 years, respectively, had received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose (Table 1). Coverage among Asian persons was higher than that among persons of other races and ethnicities, ranging from 63.4% (aged 5–11 years) to 91.8% (16–17 years), followed by Hispanic persons, with coverage ranging from 34.5% to 77.3% (Figure). Coverage was similar for Black, White, and other/multiple race persons aged 12–15 and 16–17 years. Coverage in Black children aged 5–11 years was 4.0 to 33.6 percentage points lower than that among Asian, Hispanic, and other/multiple race children of the same age (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/122810).
Coverage with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose by August 31, 2022, was higher among children and adolescents aged 12–17 years, those whose mothers had obtained a college degree, who lived in a household with yearly income ≥$75,000, who always or often wore a mask in public during the previous 7 days, and who had received ≥1 influenza vaccine dose (Table 1). Coverage among Asian and Hispanic children and adolescents was higher in most sociodemographic subgroups compared with coverage among White children and adolescents. Black, White, and other/multiple race children and adolescents had the largest variation in coverage by sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics.
Data collected during July 1–September 30, 2022, indicate that overall, 47.2% of children and adolescents received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; 43.3% completed the primary series (≥2 doses) (Table 2). Among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, primary series coverage was highest among Asian persons. Monovalent booster dose coverage was low overall (14.7%) and was highest among Asian children and adolescents (22.4%) and lowest among Black children and adolescents (9.3%). Parents of White children and adolescents of all ages reported the highest level of reluctance¶¶¶ (40.3%) to have their child vaccinated.
Parents of vaccinated children and adolescents reported high levels of confidence in the importance (93.1%) and safety (78.8%) of vaccination overall and by race and ethnicity (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/122811). Confidence in vaccine importance remained high (76.7%), but confidence in vaccine safety was considerably lower (40.2%) among parents of unvaccinated children and adolescents who might get their child vaccinated (reachable children****). Parents of reluctant and reachable children and adolescents reported substantially lower percentages of friends and family had vaccinated their children and adolescents (reflection of social norms) (6.4%–21.2%) and reported having received a provider recommendation (27.9%–35.9%) for vaccination compared with parents of vaccinated children (72.9% and 61.8%, respectively). The magnitude of these differences was similar by race and ethnicity.
Overall, reluctant parents expressed less favorable attitudes and opinions regarding vaccination than did parents of vaccinated and unvaccinated but reachable children. Among all reluctant parents, those of Black and Hispanic children and adolescents reported the highest levels of concern about their child getting COVID-19 and expressed the most confidence in the importance of the vaccine.

Discussion
COVID-19 vaccination coverage was low among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years overall, but highest among Asian and Hispanic children and adolescents. By August 31, 2022, Asian children and adolescents had substantially higher coverage than did all other children and adolescents overall and when stratified by factors associated with lower coverage for all children and adolescents, indicating a willingness across demographic and behavioral characteristics in this population to receive vaccination. During July 1–September 30, 2022, overall and among all racial and ethnic groups, most children and adolescents who initiated a primary COVID-19 vaccination series also completed the primary series, an encouraging sign of COVID-19 vaccine access and acceptance among parents who intend to vaccinate, but efforts are needed to achieve much higher coverage levels for all children and adolescents.
Lower coverage with ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose associated with some demographic and behavioral characteristics point to opportunities to improve coverage. Frequent mask use in public and receipt of influenza vaccine were associated with higher COVID-19 vaccination coverage among all children and adolescents; however, among Black and Hispanic children and adolescents with these characteristics, the increase in coverage was smaller. Less than one half of parents of Black and Hispanic children and adolescents had confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety, which might indicate reluctance to be vaccinated among a population receptive to other public health behaviors. During July 1–September 30, 2022, large proportions of Hispanic and Black children and adolescents were unvaccinated but reachable (26% and 29%, respectively), suggesting that coverage might increase over time with strengthened public health interventions. A higher proportion of parents of other/multiple race and White children and adolescents were reluctant to vaccinate their child (36% and 40%, respectively) than were considered reachable (15%), suggesting potential difficulty achieving high vaccination coverage among these children and adolescents.
Implementation of evidence-based practices described in CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccination Field Guide†††† could help increase vaccine coverage. Community members should serve as trusted messengers to advocate for vaccination among parents of unvaccinated children and adolescents and should deliver tailored messages to strengthen confidence in vaccine safety and importance. Provider recommendation is an impactful driver of vaccination (8). A multifaceted approach with community collaboration and provider recommendation are essential to increasing childhood COVID-19 vaccination coverage.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the survey response rate was low (18.1%). Data were weighted to account for household and provider nonresponse and for households without telephones and weighted to the COVID-19 vaccine administration data (≥1 doses) reported by jurisdictions to CDC. However, some bias might remain. Second, child and adolescent COVID-19 vaccination receipt was parent-reported and might be subject to recall or social desirability biases. However, limited recall bias is expected because of the recency of COVID-19 vaccination recommendations. Third, small sample sizes were available for American Indian or Alaska Native and for Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander children and adolescents; therefore, these data were aggregated in the other/multiple race category. Fourth, aggregated racial and ethnic data might obscure differences in coverage that are apparent in disaggregated subgroups (9). Data on racial and ethnic subgroups were collected, but the sample size was inadequate to analyze the disaggregated data. Finally, reporting of month and year of vaccination was incomplete for one fifth of children and adolescents who were reported to be vaccinated, requiring imputation of missing dates.
Public health efforts to increase coverage with the primary COVID-19 vaccination series in all age groups and the bivalent COVID-19 booster dose§§§§ among eligible persons should continue. These efforts should be tailored to differences in parental intent, behavioral and social drivers of vaccination, and by the child’s or adolescent’s age, race, and ethnicity. Programs should provide culturally relevant information and employ evidence-based strategies, including tailored messages delivered by trusted messengers and strong recommendations from vaccination providers, to increase vaccine confidence and coverage among all groups, and to eliminate the disparities for those with lower vaccination coverage.

Other/multiple race children and adolescents had more than one race category selected, or were identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Hispanic children and adolescents might be of any race.
§ Respondents interviewed during September 26, 2021–September 30, 2022, were included; month and year of vaccination occurred during December 2020–September 2022.
¶ Assessed by response to the question, “Has [child’s name] received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine?” Month and year of first dose was assessed by asking, “During what month and year did [child’s name] receive [his/her] first COVID-19 vaccine?”
** Kaplan-Meier estimation methods were used to calculate estimated cumulative vaccination coverage as of the end of each month from December 2020 through August 2022 using data from interviews conducted during September 26, 2021–September 30, 2022, in which the event was defined as the month and year of receipt of first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and was censored by date of interview. Vaccination status was assigned as of the end of the month before the interview.
†† Data were imputed using hot deck imputation (replacing missing values with observed values from a respondent with similar characteristics) from donor pools matched for month of interview, age group, region, and race and ethnicity.
§§ Interview data were restricted to the previous 3 months (July 1–September 30, 2022) to provide the most current assessment of vaccination coverage, parental intent, and behavioral and social drivers of vaccination. Estimates of vaccination coverage represent the cumulative percentage of children and adolescents vaccinated as of approximately the midpoint of this interview period (mid-August 2022), and estimates of coverage with ≥1 dose might differ from the Kaplan-Meier estimates as of August 31, 2022.
¶¶ Information on whether the child or adolescent was immunocompromised was not ascertained in NIS-CCM; thus, booster dose coverage estimates might include immunocompromised children and adolescents who received 3 primary COVID-19 vaccine doses.
*** Assessed by responses to six questions covering 1) concern about the child or adolescent getting COVID-19, 2) confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety, 3) confidence in COVID-19 vaccine importance, 4) percentage of friends and family who had vaccinated their children (social norms), 5) health care provider recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination, and 6) school COVID-19 vaccination requirements. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/downloads/NIS-CCM-Questionnaire-Q3-2022.pdf

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Data from the ongoing monkeypox (mpox) outbreak on cases in cisgender women and in pregnancy are limited.
What is added by this report?
Among 769 mpox cases reported among U.S. cisgender women, Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino women were disproportionately affected. Most cisgender women reported recent sexual activity with men. Twenty-three cases among pregnant or recently pregnant persons were reported and all recovered. Four pregnant persons were hospitalized for mpox, and tecovirimat was tolerated with no adverse reactions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Continued monitoring of mpox risk in cisgender women and during pregnancy is critical to assessing the impacts of mpox on sexual, reproductive, and overall health and to better understand perinatal outcomes.

Monkeypox (mpox) cases in the 2022 outbreak have primarily occurred among adult gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM); however, other populations have also been affected (1). To date, data on mpox in cisgender women and pregnant persons have been limited. Understanding transmission in these populations is critical for mpox prevention. In addition, among pregnant persons, Monkeypox virus can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy or to the neonate through close contact during or after birth (2–5). Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion and stillbirth, have been reported in previous mpox outbreaks (3). During May 11–November 7, 2022, CDC and U.S. jurisdictional health departments identified mpox in 769 cisgender women aged ≥15 years, representing 2.7% of all reported mpox cases.† Among cases with available data, 44% occurred in cisgender women who were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), 25% who were non-Hispanic White (White), and 23% who were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic). Among cisgender women with available data, 73% reported sexual activity or close intimate contact as the likely route of exposure, with mpox lesions most frequently reported on the legs, arms, and genitals. Twenty-three mpox cases were reported in persons who were pregnant or recently pregnant§; all identified as cisgender women based on the mpox case report form.¶ Four pregnant persons required hospitalization for mpox. Eleven pregnant persons received tecovirimat, and no adverse reactions were reported. Continued studies on mpox transmission risks in populations less commonly affected during the outbreak, including cisgender women and pregnant persons, are important to assess and understand the impact of mpox on sexual, reproductive, and overall health.
Data on confirmed and probable cases of mpox are electronically reported as part of national case surveillance through a standardized case report form or the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.** Data are collected by health departments and include demographic characteristics, possible exposure routes, and signs and symptoms. CDC analyzed case report data for probable or confirmed†† cases among cisgender women aged ≥15 years and pregnant persons during May 11–November 7, 2022. In addition, CDC identified all persons with mpox reported to CDC through national case surveillance and clinical consultations who were pregnant or recently pregnant regardless of gender identity. Detailed data regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes were obtained through enhanced pregnancy surveillance.§§ Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and restricted to cases with available data. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶

Cases Among Cisgender Women
During May 11–November 7, 2022, a total of 769 cases of mpox among cisgender women, including 23 (3%) who were pregnant, were reported by 42 public health jurisdictions (Table 1). The median age was 32 years (IQR = 25–40 years). Among the 717 (93%) cisgender women with information on race and ethnicity, 313 (44%) were Black, 182 (25%) were White, and 167 (23%) were Hispanic. Among 463 (60%) cisgender women with information on recent sexual behaviors, 329 (71%) reported recent sexual activity or close intimate contact,*** including 296 (90%) who had recent sexual contact with a cisgender man and 18 (6%) who had recent sexual contact with a cisgender woman. Among the 18 patients who had recent sexual contact with a woman, 12 also had a recent male sex partner. Of the 73 cisgender women who had complete exposure data, 53 (73%) reported recent sexual or intimate contact as the likely route of exposure. Among the 16 who reported household contact or caregiving as the likely route of exposure, five reported recent sexual or intimate contact. Among the 378 cisgender women with available data on immunocompromising conditions, 35 (9%) reported any known immunocompromising condition other than HIV infection. Information on HIV status was available for 173 cisgender women, 13 (8%) of whom had HIV infection; no cisgender women with HIV infection were pregnant.
Among all cisgender women with mpox and available data, the most frequently reported signs and symptoms were rash (93%), headache (54%), pruritis (57%), malaise (54%), fever (49%), and chills (49%) (Table 2). Among 376 (49%) cisgender women with data on rash location, rash was most frequently reported on the legs (48%), arms (47%), genitals (36%), and trunk (33%); 50 (16%) reported rash in one region, 63 (20%) in two regions, 57 (18%) in three regions, and 140 (45%) in four or more regions. Rash location was similar when comparing cisgender women who reported recent sexual exposure with those who did not.
Top
Cases in Currently and Recently Pregnant Persons
During May 11–November 7, 2022, 23 cases of mpox were reported during pregnancy (21) or within 3 weeks of pregnancy (two); all pregnant and recently pregnant persons with mpox identified as cisgender women on the mpox case report form††† (Table 1). Among 12 currently or recently pregnant persons with available exposure data, nine reported sexual contact and three reported household contact. Among 10 cases in pregnant persons with information on trimester of infection, three occurred during the first, four during the second, and three during the third trimester (Table 3). Rash was present in all persons. Genital lesions were reported by four currently or recently pregnant persons; none reported genital lesions near the time of delivery.
Eleven (48%) pregnant persons received tecovirimat (administered during all trimesters of pregnancy); no medication-related adverse events were reported. Four pregnant persons were hospitalized related to symptoms from Monkeypox virus infection (pain control and treatment of superimposed cellulitis) and remained pregnant at discharge. No pregnant person required intensive care, intubation, or unplanned delivery. None of the pregnant persons received vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) for treatment.
Of the 21 persons who received an mpox diagnosis during pregnancy, three have reported outcomes, including two full-term deliveries without complications (including no transmission to the infant) and one spontaneous abortion at 11 weeks’ gestation. Two pregnant persons experienced mpox symptoms within 3 days after delivery; their newborns developed lesions within 1 week of their symptom onset. Both newborns received oral tecovirimat within 48 hours of developing lesions and were treated for 10–14 days; one received VIGIV. Both newborns responded to treatment, appeared to be in good health, and were discharged home.
One recently pregnant person who was breastfeeding developed lesions 4 days postpartum, including under the breast; this person’s newborn developed symptoms with lesions on the face and chest 6 days later. Two other cisgender women who were not pregnant or recently pregnant were breastfeeding at the time of mpox diagnosis. One woman’s infant was exposed to a symptomatic household contact; she experienced symptoms 2 weeks after the infant’s diagnosis. The second woman received an mpox diagnosis following an occupational exposure; breast milk samples from this person were tested and were negative for Monkeypox virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction testing.§§§

Discussion
Monkeypox virus infections in cisgender women during May 11–November 7 constituted <3% of total U.S. cases. Consistent with disparities observed overall during the ongoing mpox epidemic, the proportion of Black and Hispanic women with mpox was higher than the proportion of Black and Hispanic women in the U.S. population (6). This finding is similar to disparities among mpox cases in the United States overall and underscores the continued need for public health efforts to provide education on prevention of mpox and ensure equitable access to mpox vaccination, testing, and treatment.
Sex or close intimate contact within 3 weeks of symptom onset was reported by nearly three quarters of cisgender women with mpox, and genital lesions were frequently reported, suggesting sexual exposure as a likely primary route of transmission. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other providers should consider mpox when examining new genital, oral, or breast lesions. Patient education regarding risks for transmission of Monkeypox virus and other sexually transmitted infections should be provided.
Genital lesions in pregnant persons pose a risk for Monkeypox virus transmission to the fetus during vaginal delivery.¶¶¶ A thorough skin and mucosal (e.g., anal, vaginal, and oral) examination for mpox lesions should be performed in persons with possible mpox near the time of delivery to identify lesions of which they might be unaware. When mpox lesions, including genital lesions, are present, shared decision-making should be considered when discussing route of delivery. Because there might be an increased risk for severe disease in newborns, breastfeeding should be temporarily delayed until criteria for discontinuing isolation have been met (lesions have resolved, the scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed).****
Clinicians caring for cisgender women and pregnant persons should become familiar with clinical considerations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of mpox†††† and should provide pre- and postexposure prophylaxis if indicated. Vaccination with JYNNEOS should be provided to eligible persons, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and providers should discuss vaccination risks and benefits.§§§§
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data for some variables such as exposure risk and HIV status were frequently missing (≤92%). Thus, these data might not represent the characteristics of the overall sample. Second, the small sample size of currently and recently pregnant persons with mpox might limit the generalizability of outcomes. Finally, additional time is needed for pregnancy completion to describe outcomes among all cases of mpox during pregnancy.
Cases of mpox have occurred primarily among adult gay, bisexual, and other MSM during the current outbreak; however, any person, including cisgender women, can also acquire infection. Public health efforts should include more emphasis on cisgender women who might be at increased risk for exposure. In addition, although most reported cases of mpox in pregnant persons have been managed in the outpatient setting, some persons might require hospitalization, and there is a risk for perinatal transmission. To mitigate this risk, pregnant, recently pregnant, and breastfeeding persons should be offered prophylaxis or treatment if indicated. Continued collection of information is critical to evaluating the risk for transmission, informing infection prevention and control, and assessing the impact of mpox on the sexual, reproductive, and overall health of cisgender women. In addition, collection of longitudinal data among pregnant persons and their infants is critical to understanding the effects of mpox on maternal and neonatal outcomes. CDC, in collaboration with health departments, will continue to follow cases in pregnant and recently pregnant persons and provide updates as data become available.

The percentage of mothers giving birth who received a diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) increased from 6.0% in 2016 to 8.3% in 2021. Increases in gestational diabetes were seen in each maternal age group, and rates rose steadily with maternal age; in 2021, the rate for mothers aged ≥40 years (15.6%) was nearly six times as high as the rate for mothers aged <20 years (2.7%).
